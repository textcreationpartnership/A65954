            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note place="margin">P. 1.</note> 
               <hi>who hath been ≈øo weak</hi> (by a figure I ≈øuppo≈øe) <hi>as to confe≈øs he is not infallible, ever to believe his own ≈øen≈øes again.</hi> Now if the Dr. thinks it decent to <hi>recant</hi> in ruffling language, and to propo≈øe his new opinions in ≈øuch a ≈øtrein of confidence and defiance; he may enjoy his own humour for me, I have once told him my mind about it, and ≈øhall give him no farther trouble on that account. And, if he likes it, he may go on and repre≈øent ≈øome of tho≈øe men; who not long ≈øince ≈øtood upon the ≈øame bottom with him, and own'd the ≈øame Principles, only with le≈øs heat and violence, by all the ≈øpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful characters and in≈øinuations he can; and at the ≈øame time tell the world he is not <hi>angry,</hi> and complain of <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>venom, changing and confining friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhips to a Party.</hi> But methinks he might have ≈øpared the An≈øwerer for writing with <hi>triumph and a≈ø≈øurance,</hi> if he had done ≈øo; except the Dr. can ≈øhew his <hi>Patent,</hi> that no body may write ≈øo but him≈øelf: And I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him, if he can find any thing in my <hi>An≈øwer</hi> or <hi>Po≈øt≈øcript,</hi> comparable to that <hi>Triumphant</hi> conclu≈øion of his <hi>Vindication; If he</hi> (his An≈øwerer) <hi>will promi≈øe to examine them</hi> (his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments) <hi>well before he an≈øwers, I ≈øhall expect to hear no more of him.</hi> Now it is a little of the thicke≈øt for a man to boa≈øt at this rate, and at the ≈øame time to charge his An≈øwerer with writing <hi>with Triumph and A≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner he might have ≈øpared the reflexion that follows, he tel s me, <hi>he ≈øhall beg leave to follow his own method, and ju≈øtifie what he hath ≈øaid in the ≈øame order he hath aid it in;</hi> And then adds, <hi>his</hi> (his An≈øwerers) <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of which, has more of art than hone≈øty in it.</hi> Now if I had mi≈ørepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented his Arguments, or perverted the ≈øen≈øe of them, or drawn from them any odious or uncharitable inferences, and with <hi>great hone≈øty</hi> in≈øinuated that he did not believe a Providence or had <hi>inclinations</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. P. 48. 58.</note> there might have been ≈øome colour for this reflexion. But if he hath notoriou≈øly done all the≈øe him≈øelf, as will plainly appear in the following di≈øcour≈øe, then his own reflexion fa≈øtens upon him, and he had better have let it alone, for his own ≈øake at lea≈øt, tho it had been civil e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for his An≈øwerer.

            <p>But as for his <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> 'tis all one to me, he may take which he likes be≈øt to <hi>ju≈øtifie</hi> his Doctrines and Argum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But the Doctor re≈øolves they mu≈øt be all one, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Convocation ≈øpeaks of the ambition of encroaching Kings, and the Rebellion of Subjects, as a means whereby Governments have been alter'd, therefore by a Government being throughly ≈øetled they mu≈øt mean u≈øurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed powers, as if it were impo≈ø≈øible for ≈øuch beginnings afterwards to acquire a Right, and to terminate in a legal Title; and till that is, the Government is as unju≈øt as the Rebellion and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment.</hi> The≈øe I own to be my words, and further that the Doctor concludes rightly from them, when he ≈øays, <hi>that according to this Author, a Government which is illegally and wickedly begun, when it is legally ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led has God's Authority, and this is all that the Convocation meant by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this the Doctor replyes, <hi>As for what he ≈øays, that I will not di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh between the means of acquiring Power, and the Power it ≈øelf; I do not indeed di≈øtingui≈øh as he does, but I di≈øtingui≈øh as the Convocation does, that the means are wicked, but the Power and Authority is Gods, which is all the di≈øtinction the Convocation makes.</hi> Very well, and which I pray are the≈øe <hi>means</hi> that are wicked that the Convocation ≈øpeaks of? I know of none but the wicked means of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the power, as by Rebellion, and ambitious encroachments; and what is the <hi>Power and Authority that is God's?</hi> The Convocation mentions no other, but a <hi>Government throughly ≈øetled,</hi> and if the Convocation di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhes between the≈øe (as it plainly does) then the Convocation di≈øtingui≈øhes as I do, whatever the Doctor di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhes; and by rea≈øon of that di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it cannot be concluded from the Convocation, that <hi>becau≈øe they ≈øpeak of the Ambition of encroaching Kings and the Rebellion of Subjects, as a means whereby Governments have been alter'd; therefore by a G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tors a≈ø≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and he hath not yet contradicted it. He tells us (as above) that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerv'd from the words of the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: That tho≈øe Princes, who have no legal right to their Thrones, may yet have God's Authority: Which (≈øaith he) I proved, becau≈øe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation ≈øpeaks of illegal, and u≈øurped Powers. But that is the Que≈øtion, which he begs and takes for granted, which yet is the main thing to be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he did not before, nor hath yet offered to prove it. The Convocation ≈øpeaks indeed of, and condemns the wicked means of acquiring Power; and the Doctor ≈øeems from thence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that by a Government through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øetled, they mean u≈øurped Powers. He ≈øays here,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 4.</note> 
               <hi>when the Convocation ≈øpeaks of the ≈øettlement of illegal Powers, which began by Ambition and Rebellion;</hi> where he manife≈øtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds what the Convocation di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhes, and becau≈øe they ≈øay they <hi>began</hi> by Ambition and Rebellion, therefore the ≈øettlement they ≈øpeak of mu≈øt needs be the ≈øettlement of illegal Powers; whereas the Convocation ≈øpeaks not one word of the ≈øettlement of illegal Powers; they ≈øpeak indeed of the ≈øettlement of Powers which began by wicked means: But the≈øe are two different things, and the Convocation plainly di≈øtingui≈øhes them. And <hi>≈øuch beginnings may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards acquire a Right, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in a Legal Title;</hi> and that I think is plainly the meaning of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, and that from this di≈øtinction, for they expre≈øly tell us, in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Convoc. p. 57.</note> that <hi>their attempts</hi> (to acquire ≈øuch Governments) <hi>of all ≈øorts are

               </gap>d a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bett wickedne≈øs, is ≈øuch a Po≈øition in Divinity, that I never before met with. I know the Doctor hath a fine notion, and talks of God's Authority; but that God's Authority was ever actually join'd with a thing, the very being of which is <hi>wicked and dete≈øtable in his ≈øight,</hi> is a notion that a man may ≈øafely conclude never entred into the heads of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</p>
            <p>This is the rea≈øon for which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the di≈øtinction, and I thought I had expre≈ø≈øed it plainly enough, but the Doctor is only plea≈øed to repeat and take no further notice of it; but in≈øtead of that, de≈øires me to ≈øhew him, <hi>where the Convocation ≈øays, that a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is illegally acquir'd cannot be throughly ≈øetled, till it becomes le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi> But what need is there for that? It is not the cu≈øtom of all Per≈øons (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever learned) to expre≈øs them≈øelves in ≈øuch a peremptory manner as the Dr. does, he tells us indeed, that God <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> make a King except he oblige the People to obey him; but that is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the manner of the learned, who are contented with affirmative expre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as more mode≈øt. But ≈øaith the Dr. <hi>if this had been their meaning it had been ea≈øily ≈øaid, and had prevented all mi≈øtakes about it, which their words without this limitation, are apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray men into,</hi> ≈øay you ≈øo, then I doubt a <hi>thorough ≈øettlement</hi> is not ≈øo plain a matter as every body can ≈øee, and the Doctor's believing his own ≈øen≈øes is but a banter: But however they might have ea≈øily ≈øaid it; and if the Doctor's ≈øen≈øe had been their meaning might they not as ea≈øily have ≈øaid that? and I wonder which is e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

And then I hope it may not be ≈øo utterly impo≈ø≈øible but a wi≈øe and grave Convocation may take them into con≈øideration. I confe≈øs I then did not, nor yet do think them otherwi≈øe than very foul and unrea≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Opinions; but for all that, I do not think but that Governments may, and actually have been di≈øturb'd by them, let the Dr. wonder as much as he plea≈øe. For there are no Opinions ≈øo wild, e≈øpecially in matters of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but what have always had too many Followers. But to let that matter alone, let us inquire into the Opinion, whether there were not then or ≈øince ≈øuch Opinions in the world, that plainly centred in this, That Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours were re≈øi≈øtable, becau≈øe they could not derive their Government from <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Noah,</hi> or by Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs nomination; and I ≈øhall leave it with him, whether ≈øuch a Notion did or can di≈øturb any Government. What does he think of the <hi>Original Power of the People</hi> and Government being nothing el≈øe but <hi>compact.</hi> This is always finally re≈øolved into this; for when the Advocates of that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are urg'd with the patriarchal Authority, with the Authority of <hi>Noah,</hi> and which was deriv'd to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and with Gods expre≈øs nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, (which they neither can nor do deny) that in the≈øe ca≈øes Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did not proceed from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The An≈øwer always is, Let them ≈øhew their de≈øcent from <hi>Noah,</hi> or Gods expre≈øs nomination, and then they ≈øhall be allow'd to have the ≈øame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.<note place="margin">Their pre≈øent Maj.

And in truth the≈øe very Opinions and Arguments (except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own and the age before us) never ≈øwarm'd more than in the time that Convocation ≈øat; and there is abundance of this fine Doctrine in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Brutus,</hi> in a book <hi>de jure Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus in ≈øubditos,</hi> in <hi>Par≈øons</hi> on the Succe≈ø≈øion, and <hi>Buchanan de jure regni,</hi> and ≈øome of them are collected by Archbi≈øhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> in his <hi>dangerous po≈øitions,</hi> who was the mo≈øt reverend Pre≈øident of this Convocation.

            <p>But the Doctor ≈øays <hi>whereas the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties occa≈øioned by the changes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of Government, e≈øpecially when a rightful Prince is di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øs'd, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øetled in the throne, are very great, and worthy of the determination of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to direct mens Con≈øciences in ≈øuch ca≈øes.</hi> Well! but ≈øuppo≈øe the≈øe <hi>great and worthy</hi> bu≈øine≈ø≈øes which the Doctor hath written two books about, the Convocation thought them to be mere <hi>Bedlam</hi> Principles, and which no man in his right mind would ever have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øputed, mu≈øt they needs determine it becau≈øe the Doctor thinks it worthy of them?

            <p>But the truth is, they have determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this point ≈øufficiently, in the Ca≈øe of <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> and <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and in this Chapter too, and the Que≈øtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us is, Whether the ≈øen≈øe that I have given, or the ≈øen≈øe which the Doctor hath given, is their Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and I am content as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ≈øays <hi>to let every one judge which is the mo≈øt probable account.</hi>

And I ≈øhall leave it with the Reader, which is the mo≈øt <hi>foreign and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ≈øen≈øe,</hi> and con≈øequently (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him) which <hi>argues the greate≈øt perver≈øne≈øs of mind;</hi> to interpret it in the u≈øual, vulgar, and univer≈øally receiv'd acceptation, or to coyne a new ≈øen≈øe of it to fit a pre≈øent turn, and in which it was never under≈øtood before.</p>
            <p>The Dr. tells us, to confirm his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That <hi>it is plain that the right and ≈øettlement of government are two very different things, for they may be parted; the fir≈øt relates to the Title, the ≈øecond to the ≈øetled Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, and exerci≈øe of government. And whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Rightful King is di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, our Author mu≈øt grant, that his ≈øettlement is gone, tho not his Right;</hi> well, if I mu≈øt grant it I mu≈øt, and what then? Then ≈øaith the Dr. <hi>if Right and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be parted, I de≈øire to know, why there may not be a Settlement without Right, and then it is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to conclude, that Settlement mu≈øt always ≈øignifie Right;</hi> and, I wonder, whoever ≈øaid that Settlement either <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways</hi> or at all <hi>≈øignify'd</hi> Right; it ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a Rightful and quiet po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, and that is neither Right ≈øingly, nor Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion ≈øingly, but both together, joyn'd with quiet from other pretences, and this is an an≈øwer to what the Dr. de≈øires to know, <hi>why if Right and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement may be parted, there may nor be a Settlement without Right,</hi> becau≈øe Settlement always includes and ≈øuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes Right, but on the contrary Right does not include nor ≈øuppo≈øe a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But this is nothing but fallacy, and by this way of rea≈øoning, a Man may prove any compounded thing to be without the nece≈ø≈øary parts of its compo≈øition. A Hou≈øe con≈øi≈øts of Walls and other things, but if the Dr. undertakes the bu≈øine≈øs, he can prove a hou≈øe to be without Walls; for it is plain, that a Wall and a Hou≈øe may be parted, and if a Hou≈øe and a Wall may be parted, then why may not a Hou≈øe be without a Wall; but let us try it in his own Conce≈ø≈øions, the page before he grants, that in the <hi>Lawyers ≈øen≈øe,</hi> Settlement ≈øignifies a Legal Settlement; now it is plain (in that ≈øen≈øe) that <hi>Right and Settlement may be parted;</hi> And <hi>whenever a Rightful Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor is di≈øpo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈øs'd, the Doctor mu≈øt grant that his Settlement is gone, tho not his Right, and if (in the Lawyers ≈øen≈øe) Right and Settlement may be parted, then</hi> (in that ≈øen≈øe) <hi>Settlement may be without Right:</hi> Which, notwith≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is contrary to what the Doctor him≈øelf acknowledges. But all this is trifling and fallacious arguing, <hi>√† Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øis ad compo≈øit a,</hi> becau≈øe the part may be without the whole, therefore the whole may be without the part, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the whole includes all the parts, therefore every part includes the whole. And how <hi>ridiculous</hi> ≈øoever it may be to conclude, that ≈øettlement ≈øignifies Right, it is not <hi>ridiculous</hi> to conclude, that the Dr. pays us with Sophi≈øtry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead of Arguments.</p>
            <p>The Doctor goes on; <hi>Nay the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of</hi> thorough <hi>plainly refers Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement to Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, and not to Right, for there are no degrees of Right, no more than there are of Truth.</hi> Now whatever another man might have ≈øaid, the Dr. cannot fairly ≈øay this, without
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107829:8"/> contradicting him≈øelf: For he tells us over and over, that two Per≈øons may have a Right to the ≈øame thing, the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurper hath a <hi>Divine</hi> Right, the di≈øpo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øed King a <hi>Legal</hi> Right to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And it is plain that the≈øe are not the ≈øame, nor equal Rights, and therefore (according to the Doctor there are degrees of Right, and degrees of Right to Government too. The U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hath a thorough Right for all the People are his Subjects, and the other hath a Right to catch it, if he can get it. This la≈øt, I mu≈øt confe≈øs is a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty kind of Right, and ≈øuch as no body ever heard of before, like the Doctor's notion of a Settlement: But it does not concern me to an≈øwer that, let the Dr. make it out as well as he can. In the mean time, ≈øuppo≈øe there are no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Right; are there no degrees of quiet and peace, may not a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be more or le≈øs interrupted in the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion? and are there no degrees of Evidence? may not the Right to a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be more or le≈øs apparent? and this is the import of <hi>throughly,</hi>

            <p>As for what the Doctor ≈øays, <hi>I ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe the Author will not deny,</hi> but that the Government was ≈øetled in fact un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the three <hi>Henries,</hi> tho in his ≈øen≈øe it was <hi>not a Legal Settlement.</hi> If the Doctor will believe the Author of the <hi>unrea≈øonablene≈øs of the new Separation.</hi> He ≈øays, that the Title to the Crown, with re≈øpect to the two Hou≈øes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lanca≈øter</hi> was di≈øputable, and the Doctor knows there is a wide difference with re≈øpect to the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, when the Title is doubtful; and when the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Right and Title is ≈øo far from being di≈øputed, that it is evidently acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. But whether the Doctor will believe that Author or no: This I have to ≈øay, that whatever Settlement there was in the Reigns of the three <hi>Henries</hi> it was <hi>≈øub ratione juris</hi> upon the ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition of Right. <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. claimed the Crown upon pretence of a Legal Right, and he was admitted on that pretence; and there is a great difference, between ≈øuppo≈øing a Legal Title, and upon that ≈øuppo≈øition owning and ≈øubmitting to it; and when there is not the lea≈øt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, nay when the Legal Title (as in the Doctor's Hypothe≈øis is plainly own'd not to be in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor. After <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> 4. had reigned nine years, and was then forced to fly out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. was again po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd of the Throne: His Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion tho own'd by a Parliament was not a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and for this rea≈øon, becau≈øe there was a vi≈øible and apparent Right in <hi>Edward</hi> 4. again≈øt him and that Right actually pro≈øecuted; and it is plain the Nation thought ≈øo, when the very acts of Parliament made in the time of that Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, were declared void <hi>ab initio</hi> and ras'd out of the Records.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107829:9"/> Right, yet if it might mean al≈øo a Settlement by the acqui≈øition of Right, it is plainly more rea≈øonable to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret that to be the ≈øen≈øe of the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; for what rea≈øon is there to put a ≈øingular ≈øen≈øe upon their words, if they will bear a received one? what rea≈øon is there to make them deliver a new doctrine contrary to the ≈øen≈øe of mankind, when their words may be fairly reconcil'd to a Doctrine generally receiv'd, and about which there is no controver≈øie: But let us hear the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's Arguments again≈øt it He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerves,<note place="margin">P. 7.</note> 1. <hi>That all the Convocation ≈øays relates to the vi≈øible and actual altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Governments and Governors, and tran≈ølation of Kingdoms brought about by the wickedne≈øs of men by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Now</hi> (≈øays he) <hi>this is matter of fact not of Right;</hi> and his rea≈øon is, <hi>unle≈øs all alterations of Government are Rightful and Legal.</hi> Now this indeed would be ≈øomething if the Convocation had required us to pay obedience <hi>to all</hi> alterations of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But they do it with this limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>when ≈øuch alterations are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øetled,</hi> and if they had thought <hi>all</hi> alterations of Government were to be obey'd, it had been impertinent to add when they are <hi>throughly ≈øetled;</hi> and I wonder, from whence he draws this Conclu≈øion: <hi>And therefore the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ≈øuch alterations is an actual not legal Settlement of them;</hi> for ≈øuppo≈øe the alterations are matter of fact, and not of Right, does it follow therefore that the Settlement of the≈øe alterations, are matter of fact and not of Right too. Alterations and the Settlement of them are two very different things; for by Settlement their very nature is alter'd, and they receive a new Character, and there is Duty and Allegiance belonging to them, when there was none before. And it is ab≈øurd and incon≈øequent to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from the nature of the Alterations, to the nature of the Settlement, which puts them into a new State, and cloaths them with Authority, and gives them a Right to Homage and Subjection; now a <hi>thorough Settlement</hi> either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the nature of ≈øuch alte ations, or it does not, if not, then how comes Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to be a duty, to alterations throughly ≈øetled, and not to the≈øe which are not ≈øo; if it does alter their nature and property, then how comes an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the nature of ≈øuch alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, to affect the notion of the tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Settlement of them? The Dr. adds, <hi>This brings the di≈øpute to matter of ≈øen≈øe</hi> (His eyes I ≈øuppo≈øe) <hi>for if ≈øuch alterations of Government, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølation of Kingdoms may be made and ≈øetled without the Death, Ce≈ø≈øion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and Pre≈øcription, then they are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary to the Settlement the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ≈øpeaks of.</hi> I ≈øuppo≈øe that which follows he intends for a Rea≈øon; <hi>for there may be an actual and vi≈øible Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement without it, which is all that is required to an actual and vi≈øible tran≈ølation of Kingdoms: And that is all the Convocation intended;</hi> That is to ≈øay, you mu≈øt believe the Doctor whether he gives any rea≈øon or no: For how does he prove, that there may be an actual and vi≈øible Settlement with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Right, or that Kingdoms may be tran≈ølated without it? I grant that the Settlement that tran≈ølates Kingdoms, is actual and vi≈øible, and ≈øo it mu≈øt be if it be a Settlement, but if the Doctor will give other People leave to believe their eyes as well as he. His Settlement is neither <hi>Actual</hi> nor <hi>Vi≈øible,</hi> for it is no Settlement at all. But for all that the Doctor adds, <hi>he who will venture to ≈øay that a new Prince can't be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and vi≈øibly ≈øetled in the Throne, while the old Rightful King is living and makes his claim, ≈øhall di≈øpute by him≈øelf for me;</hi> now this is the whole di≈øpute, and 'tis ju≈øt as if he had ≈øaid, if you will not grant what I magi≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially affirm, I will di≈øpute no longer:

            <p n="1">1. That God's Authority and a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, are actually annex'd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual wickedne≈øs and unrighteou≈øne≈øs: For the ≈øtre≈øs of the Doctors Con≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction lyes in their <hi>wicked having</hi> it, i. e. their <hi>very being</hi> in Power is wicked, their <hi>very having</hi> it is wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly; and that is, their wickedne≈øs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øtice, and unrighteou≈øne≈øs is God's Authority.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That men are bound in Con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ≈øupport and maintain a wicked and unju≈øt Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor, ev'n in his wicked and unju≈øt Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion; and which is yet more, ev'n to the manife≈øt wrong, and in direct oppo≈øition to the Right owner.</p>
            <p>The≈øe are Doctrines ≈øuited well enough to the Doctor's <hi>Hypothe≈øis;</hi> But it is no great Credit to any Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they cannot be maintain'd, but by di≈øhonouring God, and breaking up the foundations of all Righteou≈øne≈øs and Ju≈øtice in the world.</p>
            <p>The Doctor tell us, <hi>He proceeded</hi> (in the Ca≈øe of Allegiance) <hi>to prove the ≈øame thing from other Te≈øtimonies of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation Book:</hi> and of the Two fir≈øt that he mention'd he ≈øays, I thought fit to <hi>take no notice of.</hi> And it is true I did not; and the Doctor has Rea≈øon to thank me for it.<note place="margin">Ca≈øe of Alleg. p. 6.

               <note place="margin">Convoc. p. 53.</note> 
               <hi>For as they tell us el≈øewhere, The Lord both may and is able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw any Kings or Emperors, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding any Claim, Right, Title or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt, which they can challenge, to their Countreys, Kingdoms or Empires.</hi> And can the Doctor ≈øay, that by the≈øe words the Convocation means, God's making Kings by Providence? or that they make any ≈øuch inference from them, that a Per≈øon po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the Throne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Right, and contrary to it, is made a King by God, and ought to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? If the Doctor can ≈øay this, I have done wondring at any interpretations he makes either of the Convocation Book, or of the Scripture in favour of his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothe≈øis. For the Convocation in this very place does not only not refer to God's making Kings by Providence, but is as expre≈øs again≈øt the Doctor, as any thing can be. For the Convocation, ≈øpeaking of, and ju≈øtifying the facts of <hi>Jehu</hi> and <hi>Ahud</hi> in killing King <hi>Joram</hi> and <hi>Eglon,</hi> as having an expre≈øs warrant from God, and being made Kings by God's expre≈øs nomination, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately add, <q>Both which examples (being but in number two throughout the Hi≈øtories of all the Princes, Judges, and Kings either of <hi>Judah</hi> or <hi>I≈ørael</hi>) do make it known to us,</q> 
               <hi>that altho the Lord may, and is able to overthrow any Kings or Emperors, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding any Claim, Right, Title or Intere≈øt, which they can challenge to their Countreys, Kingdoms, or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires;</hi> 
               <q>yet fore≈øeeing in his Heavenly Wi≈ødom and Divine Providence, what mi≈øchief private men, under colour of the≈øe Examples, might otherwi≈øe have pretended, or attempted again≈øt their Sovereigns (as being either di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented of them≈øelves, or ≈øet into fury by other malitious per≈øons) he did ≈øo order and di≈øpo≈øe of all things in the Execution of the≈øe ≈øuch his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Judgments, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may plainly appear to any (that ≈øhould not wilfully hoodwink him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf) never to be lawful for any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon what≈øoever, upon the pretence of any Revelation, In≈øpiration, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment from his Divine Maje≈øty, either to touch the Per≈øon of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, or to bear Arms again≈øt him, except God ≈øhould fir≈øt advance the

            </p>
            <p>From whence the≈øe Two things are obvious.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the≈øe words, <hi>The Lord both may, and is able to overthrow Kings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>notwith≈øtanding any Right,</hi> &amp;c. plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refer to the facts of <hi>Ahud</hi> and <hi>Jehu,</hi> and have an immediate re≈øpect to God's ≈øetting up Kings by his <hi>expre≈øs nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and in the Kingdom of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> al≈øo, and therefore very improperly alledged to prove, that what <hi>God did by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in</hi> I≈ørael <hi>by expre≈øs nomination, he does by his Providence in other Kingdoms.</hi> For that that is the ≈øen≈øe of the Convocation, the Doctor proves, for <hi>that they tell us el≈øewhere, that the Lord may and is able,</hi> &amp;c. And yet this very <hi>el≈øewhere,</hi> has the ≈øame refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the other, and re≈øpects the <hi>Kingdom of I≈ørael,</hi> and <hi>God's expre≈øs nomination.</hi> And where is the Con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? God by expre≈øs nomination made <hi>Jehu</hi> and <hi>Ahud</hi> Princes, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized them to kill the Kings, who≈øe Subjects they were before; and he may do ≈øo again if he plea≈øe: therefore if any per≈øon, can by Providence get the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of another Princes Throne, he is a King of God's making, as much as <hi>Jehu</hi> or <hi>Ahud;</hi> and has as good autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to act as they had.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They limit and confine the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice upon this Doctrine, to God's expre≈øs Nomination. They do not mention them, either to allow or e≈øtabli≈øh a general practice upon them, but to prevent it. And it ≈øeems as if they de≈øigned to prevent that very Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the Doctor draws from them: The Doctor infers, That therefore, whoever is po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd of Power by Providence, hath God's Authority: And they infer the clean contrary, that notwith≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ≈øpecial and expre≈øs Warrant from him is nece≈ø≈øary; and granting that <hi>the Lord may and is able to overthrow Kings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>notwith≈øtanding,</hi> &amp;c. yet no man had any Authority from him, except he was <hi>expre≈øly</hi> and <hi>by name</hi> appointed by him: And the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ≈øo far from ≈øub≈øtituting Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the place of Gods nomination, that in the very Ca≈øe upon the account of which they mention the≈øe words, they ≈øay, there can be no Authority without God's expre≈øs warrant, and that ≈øuch a warrant is now <hi>impo≈ø≈øible.</hi> So that the Doctor's Interpretation and Inference is directly contrary to that of the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107829:12"/> And by this time I ≈øuppo≈øe the Doctor may be ≈øatisfied there was no ≈øuch need to call for an An≈øwer, and to tell me, <hi>I did not think ≈øit to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the≈øe Pa≈ø≈øages.</hi> And I do <hi>think fit</hi> yet further to <hi>take notice,</hi> that he hath plainly alter'd the ≈øtate of the matter with re≈øpect to the≈øe pa≈ø≈øages: In his <hi>Ca≈øe of Allegiance</hi> he produc'd this pa≈ø≈øage to prove,<note place="margin">Ca≈øe of Alleg. p 6.</note> 
               <hi>That what God did by his Prophets in</hi> I≈ørael, <hi>by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs nomination of the Per≈øon, he does by his Providence in other Kingdoms, ≈øet up Kings as he ≈øees fit, without any regard to the Right of Succe≈ø≈øion, or Legal Titles.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 9.</note> But now in his <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> we have another account: <hi>For</hi> (≈øays he) <hi>if they do not prove God's Sovereign Authority, to remove and pull down, the mo≈øt Rightful Kings, and give his Authority to tho≈øe who have no Right, and place them in the Throne, of tho≈øe that have the Right, there is no ≈øen≈øe to be made of them.</hi> And what is this to <hi>Providence,</hi> which is the main thing in controver≈øie, and for the proof of which, the Doctor cited tho≈øe pa≈ø≈øages? Suppo≈øe they do prove God's Sovereign Authority, to remove and pull down the mo≈øt Rightful Kings, and give his Authority to tho≈øe who have no Right; Do they prove like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, that a Providential po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne, is God's giving his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? or that which he did by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> he does by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in other Countries? God's So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Authority is no Que≈øtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us; The Convocation allows the Doctrine; but ≈øays withal, that no man (in tho≈øe ca≈øes) can act upon it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God's <hi>expre≈øs</hi> warrant.</p>
            <p>The Doctor expre≈ø≈øes this oddly, <hi>And give his Authority to tho≈øe who have no Right, and place them in the Thrones of tho≈øe that have the Right.</hi> If this is to be under≈øtood Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and which is the Doctor's Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the≈øis, That when God has given Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Government to a Per≈øon, he hath no Right to it; and when he hath taken them away, That Per≈øon hath ≈øtill the Right; This is neither the Sen≈øe of the Convocation, nor yet Sen≈øe. For the Convocation ≈øays, God may overthrow Kings, <hi>notwith≈øtanding</hi> any Right they can challenge; which inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates not the continuing, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining their Right; as <hi>Jeram</hi> after God had given his Kingdom to <hi>Jehu,</hi> had no longer Right to it; but was (as the Convocation ≈øays) <hi>Jehu</hi>'s Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and there is nothing more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurd, than to ≈øay, that a man hath no Right to what God gives him; and that he hath yet a Right remaining to what God takes away from him.</p>

               <hi>Our Author's Hypothe≈øis is as direct a contradiction to this, as words can make it: for if no Prince can have God's Authority, nor mu≈øt be obeyed, unle≈øs he have a Legal Right; either an old Hereditary Right, or a new acquired Right, by the Death or Ce≈ø≈øion,</hi> &amp;c. What hard ≈øhifts we are put to to ob≈øcure what will not admit of a plain an≈øwer? What is this to the purpo≈øe the Doctor cited tho≈øe pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øages, or to the Que≈øtion before us? And where, I pray, did I ever ≈øay, that no Prince <hi>can</hi> have God's Authority, without ≈øuch Rights? No doubt he may have it, if God gives it him. And that is the only Que≈øtion: <hi>Jehu</hi> had God's Authority without the≈øe Rights; But then God expre≈øly and by name, gave it to him. Let the Doctor prove, that po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, is equivalent to an expre≈øs No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; or that it is a ≈øufficient Evidence, that God hath given ≈øuch a Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor his Authority; and till then, all his Arguments from God s Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Authority ≈øignifie nothing. To argue from Gods power of di≈øpo≈øing Kingdoms, without Legal Right, to his actual di≈øpo≈øing them ≈øo; and becau≈øe he can give his Authority to one who

And <hi>cannot God ≈øet up Kings, without con≈øent of the People? then he cannot make a King: for a King without Subjects is no King: He may ≈øet a man upon the Throne, but cannot make him a King, without leave of the people.</hi> And ≈øo the Doctor may take his Rebuke again, <hi>wherever he learnt this Doctrine, I am ≈øure the Convocation never taught it him.</hi> For they have taught over and over, that the people of all ≈øorts, have no intere≈øt in, nor any thing to do with the Government: and it ≈øhould ≈øeem, that one main end of their Book, was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, and ≈øhew the fal≈øity of ≈øuch Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, into which, notwith≈øtanding the Doctor's fine Principle of the <hi>Con≈øent of the People</hi> is finally re≈øolv'd.</p>

God may now give the ≈øame liberty he did to the <hi>I≈øraelites,</hi> to ≈øpoil the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> and therefore whatever we can get from the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Church of <hi>England,</hi> is our own. I do not ≈øay the Doctor concludes ≈øo, but his Arguments do: and every one of the≈øe Con≈øequences, are as good as the Doctors. And if <hi>Providence</hi> comes in the place of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,</hi> and what God did of old by his <hi>Prophets,</hi> he does now by his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> and Providential Events convey the ≈øame Right and Authority, as God's own immediate and expre≈øs direction; then this is very good arguing; and the Doctor's Principles will ju≈øtifie ≈øuch Practices, tho He does not.</p>
            <p>But yet further, to ≈øhew the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonablene≈øs of the Doctor's Inference, and that from God's altering Stated and Legal Rules in the Ca≈øe of <hi>Jehu,</hi> and by <hi>expre≈øs nomination,</hi> nothing can be concluded in favour of a Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107829:13"/> Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion again≈øt legal Right; here are the≈øe two things to be ob≈øerv'd.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That when God ≈øet up <hi>Jehu</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt another Right and Title (and the Ca≈øe is the ≈øame of any other ≈øo ≈øet up by God) there was a clear and evident Revelation of God's Will that he had made him King, and given him his Authority, and about which there could be no doubt or ≈øcruple. And ≈øuch a clear Revelation ≈øeems nece≈ø≈øary in all ≈øuch ca≈øes. For when men are under ≈øacred Tyes and Obligations, from which they cannot otherwi≈øe be relea≈øed but by God him≈øelf (for <hi>tho God is not tied to tho≈øe Rules he pre≈øcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth to others,</hi> yet men are tied to tho≈øe Rules, the obligation of which holds them till they are di≈øcharged by God who is not tied him≈øelf, and can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea≈øe them that are;) it ≈øeems nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that the Evidence of Gods Will in di≈øcharging them, ≈øhould be as clear and <hi>certain,</hi> as the Evidence they have that the ob≈øerving the≈øe Rules is their duty; otherwi≈øe men depart from a <hi>certain</hi> duty, upon the account of an <hi>uncertain</hi> di≈øcharge from God, and may ea≈øily find ways to evade their nece≈ø≈øary duties, e≈øpecially if they are clogged with difficulty, and ≈øecular di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage. And accordingly when God ≈øet up <hi>Jehu,</hi> the manife≈øtation of God's will was plain and evident, and the per≈øons concern'd to know it, could make no doubt of it, being reveal'd by Prophets, the ordinary and accu≈øtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed way of God's making his will known to them. But for Providence, e≈øpecially in oppo≈øition to Law and legal Right, being the manife≈øtation of God's will in order to practice, I think I may appeal to all the world, whether any man can be as certain, that Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is as evident an indication of God's will that God hath given his Authority and the Government to him, as he is of the obligation of an Oath, and of the Duty of Alleg. to a rightful King; if not, then he relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes him≈øelf from an evident Duty by a di≈øcharge from God le≈øs evident; <hi>i. e.</hi> he has le≈øs evidence of his di≈øcharge than he has of his duty, and that in the ballance of Con≈øcience is no di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge at all. Now it needs not be proved, that Providence is not ≈øo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a Declaration of God's Will as expre≈øs Nomination; the Doctor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf owns that in all other Ca≈øes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is not <hi>≈øuch</hi> a ≈øignification of God's Will. And that this Doctrine could never be e≈øpied before, nay that it was publickly and profe≈ø≈øedly di≈øown'd, are no great ≈øigns of its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And therefore there is a wide difference in the two Ca≈øes. Upon the Nomination of <hi>Jehu,</hi> God's Will was made ≈øo evident, that all men concern'd to take notice of it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did nor could doubt of it: but in the ca≈øe of the Doctor's Hypothe≈øis 'tis the only thing in que≈øtion. And not only all men el≈øe, but the Doctor him≈øelf, not only doubted of it, but believ'd the clean contrary.</p>

He replies, <hi>This is a bold undertaker.</hi> And that I ≈øuppo≈øe I am to take for an An≈øwer, for he ≈øays very little be≈øide to the proofs I brought for it. But let us con≈øider what he does ≈øay.</p>
            <p>He tells us, <hi>Our fir≈øt Inquiry is what the Convocation thought of the Kings of the</hi> Aramites <hi>and</hi> Moabites, <hi>Whether they thought them legal and rightful Kings of</hi> I≈ørael? <hi>They</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>call indeed the</hi> I≈øraelites <hi>their</hi> Subjects <hi>as our Author ob≈øerves, and from thence proves that the≈øe Kings had a legal Power over</hi> I≈ørael. <hi>But the mi≈øchief is, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation in expre≈øs words owns them to be only Kings</hi> de facto, <hi>to whom they were in ≈øubjection; and teaches, that if any per≈øon born a Subject, and affirming by all the Arguments,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that God had called him to murder the King</hi> de facto <hi>under whom he lived,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which</hi> (≈øays the Doctor) <hi>is ≈øpoke with reference to</hi> Ahud<hi>'s killing King</hi> Eglon, <hi>who it ≈øeems was</hi> but <hi>a King</hi> de facto <hi>in the jugd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Convocation. And I ≈øuppo≈øe our Author knows what a King</hi> de facto <hi>≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in oppo≈øition to a King</hi> de jure, <hi>one who is King without a</hi> Legal <hi>Right.</hi> I an≈øwer yes, I do know that, but the mi≈øchief is, the Convocation does not ≈øpeak of a King <hi>de facto</hi> in oppo≈øition to a King <hi>de jure,</hi> but barely of a King <hi>de facto,</hi> and I ≈øuppo≈øe the Doctor <hi>knows,</hi> that a King <hi>de facto</hi> when it is not ≈øpoken in oppo≈øition to a King <hi>de jure,</hi> does not mean a King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a legal Right. And this is plainly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107829:14"/> the ca≈øe; for (1) it is barely and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly expre≈ø≈øed without any oppo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a King <hi>de jure</hi> either mention'd or ≈øuppos'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The matter plainly proves that it cannot be ≈øpoken in <hi>oppo≈øition</hi> to a King <hi>de jure,</hi> which is that the King <hi>de facto</hi> may not be murdered by his Subjects, but if a King <hi>de facto</hi> was ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in oppo≈øition to a King <hi>de jure,</hi> then a King <hi>de jure</hi> may be murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Subjects.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Doctor tells us, that this is ≈øpoken with reference to <hi>Ahud</hi>'s kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King <hi>Eglon,</hi> and therefore King <hi>Eglon</hi> was but a King <hi>de facto.</hi> But then this is a rea≈øon that the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not ≈øpeak it in oppo≈øition to a King <hi>de jure;</hi> for in the Chapter to this Canon, they ≈øpeak with reference to the ≈øame, <hi>That the Lord may and is able to overthrow any Kings or Emperors notwith≈øtanding any</hi> Claim, Right, Title <hi>or Intere≈øt which they can challenge to their Countries, Kingdoms or Empires.</hi> The≈øe words were plainly ≈øpoken with reference to <hi>Ahud</hi>'s killing King <hi>Eglon,</hi> and the Convocation prefaces thus: Both which Examples (<hi>i. e.</hi> of <hi>Jehu</hi> and <hi>Ahud</hi>) do make it known to us, that although the Lord may and is able to overthrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor tells us but the page before,<note place="margin">P. 9.</note> that there is no ≈øen≈øe to be made of the≈øe words, if they do not prove God's ≈øovereign Authority to remove and pull down the <hi>mo≈øt</hi> rightful Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this was ≈øpoken with reference to God's pulling down King <hi>Eglon</hi> by <hi>Ahud.</hi> But then <hi>Eglon</hi> was ≈øo far from being a King <hi>de facto</hi> in oppo≈øition to a King <hi>de jure,</hi> that he was not only a rightful King, but a <hi>mo≈øt</hi> rightful King. And therefore the mi≈øchief (the Doctor ≈øpeaks of) that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation in <hi>expre≈øs words</hi> owns the Kings of the <hi>Aramites</hi> and <hi>Moabites</hi> to be <hi>only</hi> Kings <hi>de facto,</hi> is no other mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief but that the Doctor contradicts him≈øelf, but that is no mi≈øchief with him, otherwi≈øe he would not u≈øe it ≈øo often. And here we plainly ≈øee the Doctor's admirable dexterity in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the Convocation to his own purpo≈øe. The Convocation ≈øays <hi>King de facto</hi> and no more, but it ≈øeems that would not do, and therefore the Doctor ≈øays, they ≈øay <hi>only</hi> King <hi>de fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto,</hi> and <hi>but</hi> King <hi>de facto;</hi> but the≈øe Additions (which perfectly alter the ≈øen≈øe) are no bodies but his own, and yet it ≈øeems it was not enough to put them in, but he mu≈øt tell us al≈øo, the Convocation in <hi>expre≈øs words</hi> owns them to be <hi>only</hi> Kings <hi>de facto,</hi> when the Convocation hath not any ≈øuch word, or any thing like it.</p>
            <p>The Doctor proceeds,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Let us now ≈øee what legal Right and Title our Author hath found, for the Kings of the</hi> Aramites <hi>and</hi> Moabites <hi>and</hi> Babylonians <hi>over</hi> I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>and for all the four Monarchies; and that is the ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion both of Prince and People.</hi> Well, that is one of them, but not all, <hi>which</hi> (≈øays the Doctor) <hi>he ≈øays I grant gives a legal Right,<note place="margin">Po≈øt≈øcrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And I think al≈øo, that ≈øaying <hi>he tells us</hi> differs a little from ≈øaying <hi>he grants.</hi> So that I think this might have been ≈øpared: But the Doctor had a mind to charge me with a fault, and he hath thereby ≈øhew'd him≈øelf to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty of it. However I take this opportunity to tell him, that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to me, whether or no he grants that the ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion of the Prince and People confer a legal Right, all the world be≈øides grant it, and that is ≈øufficient for any ordinary Principle

            <p>But now the Doctor tells me, <hi>The truth is our Author is here blundered for want of clear and di≈øtinct Notions of what he writes, and impo≈øes upon him≈øelf and others with ambiguous terms.</hi> This is a terrible bu≈øine≈øs if the Doctor could but ≈øhew us where this blundering and the≈øe ambiguous terms were. I had told him as plain as I could ≈øpeak, that be≈øides lineal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcent, <hi>a Right to a Government might be acquir'd by the death or ce≈ø≈øion of the right heir, joyn'd with the con≈øent of the People, and by Pre≈øcription; and when ≈øuch a Right re≈øpectively was attain'd, the Government was then a legal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> I think this is di≈øtinct enough, and the Notions are clear enough: and if the Doctor would have given a direct An≈øwer, he ≈øhould have ≈øhewn that either a Right to a Government by the≈øe ways is not attain'd, or if it be, that the Governments the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation ≈øpeaks of, and requires Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to, had not attain'd ≈øuch a Right: but in≈øtead of that he runs on with a company of di≈øtinctions about <hi>legal,</hi> and learnedly ≈øhews how many ≈øeveral ways Powers may be ≈øaid to be <hi>legal.</hi> And what is all that to me, and to the purpo≈øe? By legal Powers I under≈øtand what he under≈øtands by them, if he under≈øtands any thing by them, and that is legal Powers in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition to u≈øurped Powers. U≈øurped Powers are ≈øuch as have no Right, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Powers are ≈øuch as have a Right, as well a Right acquir'd, as by lineal de≈øcent, and ≈øuch Powers by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent of all mankind are legal Powers, and U≈øurpers the contrary. And the Doctor knows well enough this is my ≈øen≈øe, and hath quoted it too but two or three pages before: but the truth is,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 6.</note> the Doctor is blunder'd for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer; and to avoid giving a clear and di≈øtinct An≈øwer, falls a di≈øtingui≈øhing to no purpo≈øe at all, and on pretence of truly ≈øtating, confounds the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion, and runs from it, which is blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering with a witne≈øs. Has the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation any thing to do with his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinctions? When they call the Roman Governors the <hi>lawful Magi≈øtrates</hi> of the Jews, do they mean <hi>lawful</hi> by the law of Nature? And this I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned:<note place="margin">Po≈øt≈øcript p. 3.</note> and he will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly an≈øwer, but hides him≈øelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der di≈øtinctions, and tells us fine things of a ≈øtate of nature when all men are free, and may di≈øpo≈øe of them≈øelves as they will, and of Conque≈øt and a prevailing force, when they have the ≈øame liberty as in a ≈øtate of nature. And what is all this to a King by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> and to the <hi>Convocation book?</hi> If the Doctor has a mind to put the matter upon that i≈ø≈øue, let him give his rea≈øons, and I will ≈øubmit to them, or an≈øwer them. But for my part, I love to end one Controver≈øie before I begin another, and do not much care to be drawn from the matter in hand by impertinent Di≈øtinctions which are nothing to the purpo≈øe. Well! but the Doctor tells us, <hi>That</hi> Legal <hi>(as it re≈øpects the Laws and Con≈øtitutions of a particular Nation or Kingdom) is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood by all men, who under≈øtand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, in this controver≈øie of</hi> Legal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. <hi>This is the rea≈øon of the di≈øtinction between a King</hi> de jure <hi>and a King</hi> de facto; <hi>a King</hi> de jure <hi>is a rightful King by the Laws of the Land, a King</hi> de facto <hi>whatever Right he may have is not rightfully and lawfully po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd of the Crown, by the Laws of Succe≈ø≈øion, proper to that Kingdom. And this</hi> (≈øays he) <hi>is all the my≈øtery I intended.</hi> That is to ≈øay, the Doctor hath written two books to prove that a per≈øon who is not next Heir may be King and have God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: a wonderful di≈øcovery! I had told him ≈øo over and over, and ≈øhew'd him in what Ca≈øes, when a Right was
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107829:15"/> acquir'd by <hi>Death, Ce≈ø≈øion,</hi> or <hi>Pre≈øcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</hi> But this it ≈øeems is <hi>blundering, ambiguous,</hi> and a man does <hi>not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand</hi> him≈øelf. But to ≈øay that the ≈øame thing is by the <hi>Con≈øent and Submi≈ø≈øion of the People,</hi> this is very clear and di≈øtinct, and the Doctor under≈øtands him≈øelf, tho no body el≈øe except ≈øome Commonwealths men, are able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand it. But this is nothing but ≈øhifting the Que≈øtion, and the Doctor (I'll warrant you) does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand the force of my Argument; and yet he tells us here, <hi>Let us ≈øee what Legal Right and Title our Author hath found for the Kings of the</hi> Aramites <hi>and the Moabites, and for the four Monarchies, and that is the ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion both of Prince and People.</hi> Very well, and why did not he give a direct An≈øwer to that? Does the ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion of the Prince and People make ≈øuch a Government a <hi>legal</hi> Government and no U≈øurpation? And the next Que≈øtion is, Had not the <hi>Aramites, Moabites, Babylonians,</hi> and all the Governments the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ju≈øtifie Obedience to, <hi>≈øuch</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent and Submi≈ø≈øion? and if they had then they were legal Kings and not U≈øurpers. And this was the ≈øub≈øtance of my An≈øwer, and to which I had added for Confirmation, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation mentions but two U≈øurpers (<hi>Athaliah</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi>) and ju≈øtifies the Re≈øi≈øtance of them both. And what does the Doctor ≈øay to this? Why fir≈øt of all I am a <hi>bold Undertaker,</hi> ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly 'tis <hi>blundering and ambiguous,</hi> and la≈øt of all there are ≈øeveral ≈øences of <hi>Legal;</hi> and if there were as many hundred <hi>≈øenecs</hi> of <hi>Legal</hi> what is that to the purpo≈øe? I u≈øe it but in one <hi>≈øen≈øe,</hi> and that is in oppo≈øition to <hi>U≈øurpation,</hi> and ≈øo all men el≈øe u≈øe it, in the di≈øpute between <hi>legal</hi> and <hi>u≈øurped</hi> Powers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Doctor thinks they under≈øtand them≈øelves or no. But here is a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der point, the Doctor cannot deny it, and yet is unwilling to own it; it would be ridiculous for a man that talks ≈øo much of the Con≈øent and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion of the <hi>People,</hi> to deny that the Submi≈ø≈øion of the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>People</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether did not transfer a Right to the Government; and if he ≈øhould own it, then he mu≈øt own likewi≈øe that all the Governments the Convocation require Obedience to, had acquir'd <hi>≈øuch</hi> a Right, And therefore it was far better to make Di≈øtinctions and ask Que≈øtions to ob≈øcure the bu≈øine≈øs, than to bring the plain matter in controver≈øie on foot by a direct and categorical An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer. But the Doctor tells me <hi>≈øuch le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Rights as I have found for the≈øe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will quickly tran≈øub≈øtantiate all U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Powers into Legal Governments.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 10.</note> Not all ≈øure, for I expre≈øly limit it to the acqui≈øition of Right by the Death or Ce≈ø≈øion of the right Heir, and by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription: and if the Doctor plea≈øe, I except one, and he may prove it if he can, that is a Government by the Con≈øent and Submi≈ø≈øion of the People in oppo≈øition to the actual claims and pretences of an undoubted rightful King; which is as directly contrary to the Rights I have mention'd as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's thorough Settlement is to that of the Convocation.</p>
            <p>In an≈øwer to the Doctor's ≈øaying <hi>that the Kings of the</hi> Aramites <hi>and</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abites <hi>could have no legal Right to the Government of</hi> I≈ørael, I had ≈øaid <hi>they had a legal Right, if the Submi≈ø≈øion of the Prince could transfer a legal Right, which the Doctor ≈øaid it might be thought to do.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 12.</note> Now the Doctor tells us <hi>all the my≈øtery he intended</hi> was that That could not <hi>be according to the Con≈øtitution of the Jewi≈øh Commonwealth,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>But to this I made an Objection,<note place="margin">Po≈øt≈øcript. p. 3.</note> 
               <hi>If it be ≈øaid that God was at that time their Sovereign, and he did not ≈øubmit, 'tis

And the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer is as extravagant as the Objection, for</hi> (≈øays he) <hi>he has found out ≈øomething which he thinks equivalent to God's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion to the</hi> Aramites <hi>and</hi> Moabites, <hi>and that is,</hi> that God had delivered them into their hands. <hi>What then? Did God re≈øign his Government of</hi> I≈ørael <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the</hi> Aramites <hi>and</hi> Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, <hi>and quit his Right and Claim to the Government of them?</hi> Spectatum ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øi. ‚Äî Let the Doctor's friends ≈ømile as well as him≈øelf. Now I do not know what force there may be in <hi>≈ømiling,</hi> but I have ≈øeen that u≈øed when men have nothing to an≈øwer. And whether that be the ca≈øe I ≈øhall refer to the Reader. And here I ≈øhall do two things, 1. I ≈øhall vindicate the An≈øwer I have given, and 2. Con≈øider what the Doctor offers to ju≈øtifie the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion and Subjection of the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To vindicate the An≈øwer: And the fir≈øt thing I have to ob≈øerve is that there is no incongruity in the Expre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion (as ridiculous as the Doctor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øents it) to ≈øay that God may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign his immediate Government over a People as their political King. This was done in fact upon the cea≈øing of the <hi>Theocracy</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah.</hi> Now in the pre≈øent ca≈øe the Text ≈øaith expre≈øly that <hi>God delivered them into the hands of the</hi> Moabites <hi>and</hi> Aramites. And what does that intimate, but that God had ≈øo far parted with his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Government as their political King? for if God was at that time their political King, how came the <hi>I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> to be the <hi>Subjects</hi> of the≈øe Kings? Might they transferr their Alleg. from God too, when he in≈øi≈øted upon his Right to govern them? But if God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them (for the puni≈øhment of their ≈øins) to be <hi>Subjects</hi> to tho≈øe Kings, and delivered them as ≈øuch into their hands, and the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> knew that he did ≈øo, it is plain that God ≈øo far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented that they ≈øhould be their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. And tho the Doctor will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the pre≈øumed <hi>con≈øent</hi> of the Prince ≈øignifies any thing, I hope he will not think ≈øo of the expre≈øs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent of God. Now the Convocation plainly a≈ø≈øerts that the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> were the <hi>Subjects</hi> of the≈øe Kings, and the Doctor's Argument proceeds upon the ≈øuppo≈øition of it. And the Que≈øtion is how they became ≈øo? Either God at that time was their political King, or he was not; if he was, Which way ≈øhould they become <hi>Subyects</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince? I doubt, for all his laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it will puzzle the Doctor to give another account of it. If God was not their political King, then tho≈øe in whom the Right of the Government was, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the People, had ≈øubmitted, and had thereby made the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Aramites</hi> and <hi>Moabites</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them <hi>Legal Governments.</hi> But of this more pre≈øently.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To con≈øider what the Doctor hath found out to ju≈øtifie the Submi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> and their beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Subjects to the≈øe things. And here we are got into a field of <hi>Di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> and nothing at all to the purpo≈øe.

            <p>And this is that which he gives as a Rea≈øon to ju≈øtifie the Submi≈ø≈øion of the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> to the <hi>Aramites</hi> and <hi>Moabites;</hi> for it follows, <hi>All men will grant that no humane Laws and Con≈øtitutions are ≈øo ≈øacred as the po≈øitive Laws of God; that Government and Polity which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf pre≈øcribed to the Children of</hi> I≈ørael, <hi>which they were religiou≈øly bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve by vertue of their Covenant with God, which certainly was as ≈øacred as any oath. Now tho≈øe Laws did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of the Authority and Government of Strangers, but expre≈øly forbad it, that had they cho≈øe to be governed by any foreign Prince, they had greatly ≈øinned in it; but this very Law, as ≈øacred as it was, gave way to nece≈ø≈øity; and when they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd by the</hi> Aramites <hi>or</hi> Moabites, <hi>or any other Nation, it was no fault to ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to them. And if force would ju≈øtifie this in the</hi> I≈øraelites <hi>who had God for their King, and were oblig'd by their Covenant with him to accept of no foreign Prince to govern them, it is hard if it will not ju≈øtifie the Subjects of humane Governments (mo≈øt of which were at first founded in mere force, whatever their Oaths and Obligations be to ≈øubmit to a new and greater force.</hi> This is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ≈øtate of the matter, and I ≈øhall con≈øider it immediately.</p>

And therefore, in an≈øwer I ≈øhall only tell him, that 'tis every jot as good a ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, as the Doctor's notion of a Settlement is a Settlement, <hi>i. e.</hi> 'tis none at all. <hi>But</hi> (≈øays he) <hi>if nothing be</hi> a ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, but renouncing his Right, and making <hi>a formal re≈øignation and conveyance of power;</hi> that is, I ≈øuppo≈øe, under hand and ≈øeal<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and before ≈øufficient witne≈ø≈øes. But what now, if nothing of that be nece≈ø≈øary? what if a virtual Re≈øignation be ≈øufficient? When the King of <hi>Spain</hi> treated witht the united Provinces as a Soveraign State; all the World were ≈øatisfied, that that was a Ce≈ø≈øion; and ≈øo is the ≈øubmitting to be a Subject, or other equivalent acts, tho there be no formal conveyance of Power. And now the Doctor <hi>de≈øires to know how the Author will prove, that the</hi> I≈øraelites thus <hi>≈øubmitted to the</hi> Aramites, Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, <hi>or</hi> Babylonians. I tell him, I will not prove that they made a formal Re≈øignation. And there is no need to prove the other, for they actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came their Subjects; nay, the Doctor ≈øays, <hi>what other ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion they made but a bare yielding to force and power;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 13.</note> and that proves it too, for he tells us, <hi>that is a voluntary con≈øent, the extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by force, as all Morali≈øts allow ≈øuch a mixt choice and election to be</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The next main Que≈øtion the Doctor asks is, <hi>Can the ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion of the King give a Legal Right to the Crown, without the ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion of the People?</hi> I had told him no, but both together, and what then; <hi>if not</hi> (≈øays he) <hi>it ≈øeems the People may have ≈øome Right, if not to the Government, yet to give away the Goverment of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves.</hi> Some Right? no doubt of it, the Prince cannot give the Government of the People to whom he plea≈øe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their own con≈øent? and therefore what? The People may give it away without his con≈øent? that I think will hardly follow; the People have ≈øome Right, but have they all? and to be ≈øure they can give away no more Right than they have; and what is their Right, they have a Right not to be di≈øpos'd of to any Prince be≈øides their own, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their own con≈øent. But have they any Right to throw off their own King and take another? yes, ≈øays he, <hi>if the con≈øent and ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion of a People can make a King when they have none, why can it not do ≈øo, when they are under a new force and power, which is the ≈øame ≈øtate, as if they had no King?</hi> that is becau≈øe when they are free, and have no King, they may make one; therefore when they are not free, and when they have a King, they may make another King. This is a pure con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the rea≈øon why they may make a King when they have none, is becau≈øe the power is then in them, and they may delegate it, or di≈øpo≈øe it as they plea≈øe, or they may take it them≈øelves;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107829:21"/> but the Que≈øtion is, whether they can give it when they have it not; and the being under force is a pretty odd rea≈øon that they have it: But ≈øaith he, <hi>it is the ≈øame ≈øtate, as if they had no King;</hi> not quite the <hi>≈øame ≈øtate</hi> ≈øure, for if they had no King the Sovereign Power was in them, and then they might give it away, becau≈øe they would give away no more than their own.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His next Que≈øtion is, <hi>Can't every Private man, or any City or Garri≈øon, when they are over-powered and cannot be relieved by their Prince, ≈øubmit for them≈øelves to the Conqueror, without the ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion of their Kings?</hi> I pray mark the con≈øequence, and therefore the ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion of the Prince and People does not give a Legal Right; for that was the thing the Doctor was to prove here; but in≈øtead of that, he asks ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Que≈øtion, <hi>do they not by ≈øuch ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion, according to the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, become the Subjects of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror till they are retaken?</hi> Now the≈øe the Doctor takes for granted, and proceeds upon it, and draws a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion from thence, that therefore a whole Nation may do ≈øo, but for all that there is nothing more extravagant, and no man believes it. Does a private man when he is taken Pri≈øoner, or a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of men when they are overpowered and taken, forthwith become the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the Conqueror? all the World knows the contrary when a Garri≈øon is taken, the Walls and Bulwarks are the Conquerors; but the men are his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoners, and not his Subjects. But it ≈øeems according to the Dr. Men are taken like Bea≈øts, nay like the wilde≈øt ≈øort <hi>(ferae naturae)</hi> the property fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion: But every Soldier can teach him a better Doctrine; In the Wars heretofore, and even in tho≈øe now in the World, how few in≈øtances are the≈øe of the Subjects of one Prince (I except Soldiers of fortune not Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) who when taken Pri≈øoners have li≈øted them≈øelves, and taken pay under the enemy, and actually fought again≈øt their own King and Ma≈øter. Some ≈øuch Renegadoes there have been; but they have always been branded with Infamy, and if retaken are ≈øure to pay for it; for to treat ≈øuch perfidious violators of their Faith and Honour, as the wor≈øt of enemies, has been the practice of all Princes and all Nations. And yet the Dr. in this ca≈øe appeals to the Law of Nations; by which, he tells us before, he means general practice and u≈øage: I am content to let that decide the point; and if a Soldier changing ≈øides (upon his being taken) and taking pay under the enemy again≈øt his own King, be in the e≈øtimate of the World perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to a high degree, and a man of no honour; then the Doctor's Principles (maintaining he may do ≈øo) are neither Principles of Honour, nor Con≈øcience.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He has another Que≈øtion, <hi>Has a Nation no right when the King is gone, to pre≈øerve them≈øelves by making the be≈øt terms they can with the new powers?</hi> yes, no doubt the be≈øt terms they can hone≈øtly. But where is the con≈øequence again, and therefore the ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion of the Prince and People cannot give a Legal Right; he tells us his Que≈øtions are in an≈øwer to that.</p>
            <p n="5">5. His next is a very plea≈øant Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion, <hi>For what will our Author ≈øay to the ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion of</hi> Jaddus <hi>and the</hi> Jews <hi>to</hi> Alexander, <hi>while</hi> Darius <hi>was living.</hi> Now the Dr. knows well enough, I have ≈øaid more to it than he hath an≈øwer'd, or than he will an≈øwer in ha≈øt; and he tells us, he will not engage in the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, but a≈ø≈øigns me over to a more learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an≈øwerer, and yet asks me what I will ≈øay to it.

            <p>The next thing is the Ca≈øe of <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> and <hi>Athaliah,</hi> the ≈øtory of which in the Convocation the Dr repeats at large, and thither I refer the Reader, not thinking it nece≈ø≈øary to tran≈øcribe it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">An≈øw. p. 17.</note>My Argument from thence, which the Dr. cites truely was this; <q>It is plain the Convocation does not conceive, that the injoyment of the Crown with all its dignities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is that thorough Settlement to which is due ≈øubjection and obedience as to God's Authority. <hi>Athaliah</hi> per≈øonally injoyed the Crown with all its dignities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all places of tru≈øt and power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were in her hands and at her di≈øpo≈øal </q>(which was the very account the Author I di≈øpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted again≈øt had given of a thorough Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement) <q>and this for no le≈øs a time than ≈øix years, and in as full and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a manner, as any U≈øurper or any Rightful King ever injoy'd them; but for all that the Convocation is ≈øo far from urging obedience to her, as to God's Authority, that they expre≈øly ju≈øtifie the re≈øi≈øting, nay the ≈ølaying her. And this is a clear demon≈øtration, that by a thorough Settlement, the Convocation does not mean a full po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øion of power meerly, for they ≈øay when a Government is fully ≈øetled, it ought to be obey'd as God's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not only for fear, but al≈øo for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience ≈øake; but they ≈øay al≈øo, that when <hi>Athaliah</hi> was fully po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, She ought not to be obey'd, but to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øted and ≈ølain: And the conclu≈øion from the≈øe premi≈øes is, that to be fully po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the Throne, is not of it ≈øelf to be ≈øo throughly ≈øetled as to make it God's Authority, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to become a duty.</q>

            <p>But the Dr. gives a rea≈øon, why I have not given the true notion of a full and ≈øetled Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, for (≈øaith he) he <hi>hath left out the principal part of it, as I ≈øtate it, when the E≈øtates of the Realm, and the great body of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has ≈øubmitted to ≈øuch a Prince.</hi> Now it is true I have left it out, and how ≈øhould the Dr. expect I ≈øhould do otherwi≈øe; for he knows I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that is the true notion of a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and I do not believe that the Dr. can prove that it is: But I ≈øuppo≈øe the Dr. means, that becau≈øe I ≈øaid that <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> was fully po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the Throne, and did not ≈øay likewi≈øe, that the E≈øtates of the Realm and the great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Nation ≈øubmitted to her; therefore my Argument does not affect him. And what the Convocation ≈øays of depo≈øing and ≈ølaying <hi>Athaliah,</hi> does not relate to a ≈øetled Government; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it appears, that according to the Drs. notion of it, the E≈øtates of the Realm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had ≈øubmitted to her; and therefore a ≈øetled Government may have God's Authority, and ought to be obey'd, tho <hi>Athaliah</hi> had not God's Authority and might be depos'd, becau≈øe ≈øhe was not ≈øetled according to the Drs. account, by the ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion of the E≈øtates of the Realm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This I take to be his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tho he has not expre≈øs'd it; but I know I mu≈øt be careful of giving his meaning, lea≈øt he be angry, and tell me again, he <hi>will an≈øwer for none of my ≈øen≈øes.</hi> And therefore if this be not his ≈øen≈øe,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 71.</note> I de≈øire him in his next to tell me what is, for I can make no other ≈øen≈øe of it; But methinks a man that is ≈øo very humour≈øom and touchy, ≈øhould be careful to deliver his ≈øen≈øe a little plainer, and not leave men to gue≈øs, and to make it out for him. But if that be his ≈øen≈øe, then I make this An≈øwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I do own, that the People of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> (at lea≈øt the more con≈øcientious part of them) did not ≈øubmit to <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> ≈øo as to become her Subjects, and Parties to her Government. But I do believe notwith≈øtanding, that a great part of them, and perhaps the greate≈øt did ≈øide with her and abet her. For it is plain, that She had a Party enough to maintain her Government, and tho≈øe that would not own it were not able to oppo≈øe her. Had <hi>Jehoiada</hi> been ≈øtrong enough, I think there is no doubt but he would have depo≈øed her, and e≈øtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhed <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> long before. But at the end of ≈øix years, he had a great acce≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Party (which probably he had at that time been preparing and working them into a ≈øen≈øe of their duty to their lawful King) and there can hardly be given any other account, why he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the U≈øurpation ≈øo long; for if the mere ≈øhewing the King would have done it, and have turned the hearts of the People, <hi>that</hi> might as well have been done ≈øome years before; and the Kingdom have been ≈øet upon the Right bottom, and the mi≈øchiefs of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed U≈øurpation have been prevented. But it is no wonder, that power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt ≈øhould prevail again≈øt Duty and Con≈øcience. Men in tho≈øe days as well as others might have their Principles corrupted, and their morals poy≈øoned, what Arguments they had to ju≈øtifie them≈øelves by, does not appear (the Drs. two Books would have ≈øtored
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107829:23"/> them with abundance) but a little Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument with a great Intere≈øt, will go a great way. And it is plain, it was ≈øix years before they came to a ≈øen≈øe of their duty; and there is little doubt to be made, but <hi>Jehoiada</hi> travail'd all that time with them, to reduce them: and probably upon ju≈øt Conviction, they de≈øerted the U≈øurper, and joyn'd them≈øelves to <hi>Jehoiada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Que≈øtion is not, What they did, but what they ought to have done: That a great part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom did ≈øubmit to her, I think there is no di≈øpute; and it is as little, that a great many did not: and the Que≈øtion is. Who of the≈øe, according to the Principles of the Convocation, ought to be ju≈øtified, and who ought to be condemn'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Dr. him≈øelf a≈ø≈øerts, they did ≈øubmit; and ≈øo <hi>Athaliah</hi> was ≈øetled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Notion of a Settlement; and then my Argument affects him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Que≈øtion is not, What is the Drs. Notion, but what is the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's Notion of a Settlement? and I readily grant, that according to that, <hi>Athaliah</hi> was not ≈øetled; nor that they thought ≈øhe was: But the Rea≈øon is, becau≈øe ≈øhe was an U≈øurper, and the Right Heir of the Kingdom was alive, and not becau≈øe the People had not ≈øubmitted. For, if they did ≈øubmit (as the Dr. ≈øays they did) that made no alteration in the Ca≈øe; they were bound notwith≈øtanding to return to their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ki g, and to Depo≈øe the U≈øurper, whether they had, or not ≈øubmitted. And the truth is, there is ≈øcarcely any thing the Convocation more obviates, than the Notion of <hi>Peoples Con≈øent</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing any thing to the Government, or to their own Duty.

And if they were granted him, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not from thence prove, that Allegiance is not due to a Rightful Prince di≈øpo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈øs'd, or while an U≈øurper is upon his Throne, or that the <hi>Jews</hi> did not pay Allegiance to <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> before he was anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or at the ≈øame time that <hi>Athaliah</hi> was on his Throne.</p>
            <p>But the Dr. ≈øtarts a new Que≈øtion, and that is, Whether a Private man may kill an U≈øurper? and expatiates upon it, and has it in I know not how many places in his Book, tho it be nothing at all to the purpo≈øe: Perhaps he would have me give ≈øome An≈øwer to that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he can di≈øpute about it. I can tell him, that Bi≈øhop <hi>Buckeridge,</hi> and other Learned men have a≈ø≈øerted it: and if he have a mind to it, he may try his faculty, and di≈øpute the Point again≈øt them. But I do not know any rea≈øon, to mix it in the Pre≈øent Controver≈øie, which is about Submi≈ø≈øion, and Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Allegiance to U≈øurped Powers: And I think there is ≈øome difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Killing, and Swearing Allegiance to an U≈øurper.</p>
            <p>I now come to his Second An≈øwer, which relates to his di≈øtinction of God's Entailing the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> to <hi>David</hi>'s Po≈øterity, &amp; of other Kingdoms, where Entails are made by Providence; and to this I had given ≈øeveral An≈øwers.</p>

               <hi>and ≈øo does not affect their ≈øen≈øe.</hi> To this the Dr. replies, <hi>I grant it.</hi> And then it ≈øeems, there may be a fair account given of the Depo≈øing and Slaying <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaliah,</hi> without having recour≈øe to the Drs.

But then I would fain know, how it comes to affect the Ca≈øe of <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> and <hi>Athaliah</hi> ≈øo much, that it can by no means be ≈øolv'd without it. I know the Dr. ≈øays, <hi>he did not concern the Convocation Book in the Story.</hi> But I think that makes no great matter: the Convocation concern'd them≈øelves in the ≈øtory; and that may do as well as if the Dr. him≈øelf had concern'd them in it, and very punctually declare and ju≈øtifie <hi>Jehoiada</hi>'s ≈øetting up <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> the Rightful King, and ≈ølaying <hi>Athaliah</hi> the U≈øurper. And that it ≈øeems may be done without the help of the Drs. Di≈øtinction; for that does not affect their Sen≈øe. But ≈øaith he, <hi>tho the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation takes notice of the Story, yet they neither make nor an≈øwer this Objection</hi> (which the Dr. rai≈øed from the Story) <hi>in direct terms.</hi> But if the Objection be concerning the Anointing <hi>Joa≈øh,</hi> and the Depo≈øing and Slaying <hi>Athaliah,</hi> they had made it ≈øufficiently; and as for an≈øwering it <hi>in direct terms,</hi> if by that the Dr. means, they have not an≈øwer'd it as he hath done, it is true enough; but for all that, they have an≈øwer'd it <hi>directly</hi> enough; and the whole Chapter and Canon were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign'd
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107829:26"/> for an An≈øwer to it. But ≈øtill the Dr. tells us, <hi>they had another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign in mentioning it, and fitted their an≈øwers wholly to that, That no Prie≈øts in the Old Te≈øtament, did ever De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe from their Crowns, any of their Kings,</hi>

               <hi>how wicked ≈øoever; or had any Authority ≈øo to do. And becau≈øe the Example of</hi> Jehoiada <hi>u≈øed to be urged by them to this purpo≈øe, they ≈øhew that no ≈øuch thing can be proved from it.</hi> Very well, and ≈øo they do. And do they not al≈øo tell us, that <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the <hi>High Prie≈øt</hi> ≈øet up <hi>Joa≈øh,</hi> and ≈ølew <hi>Athaliah?</hi> and therefore <hi>tho it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved</hi> (as the Convocation ≈øays) <hi>that any Prie≈øts in the Old Te≈øtament did ever depo≈øe from their Crowns any of their Kings,</hi> yet it can be proved, that <hi>Jehoiada</hi> re≈øtor'd the Rightful King, and ≈ølew the U≈øurper.

            <p>And now let us compare with the≈øe, the Ca≈øe before us; here is a plain Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Setting up a Rightful King,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107829:27"/> and of Depo≈øing and Slaying an U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and that Example ju≈øtified by the Convocation. Is it po≈ø≈øible for the Dr. him≈øelf, or for any man el≈øe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that if the Covocationn had thought that <hi>(in the≈øe days)</hi> an U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ought not to be depo≈øed, or that men were not bound to pay Allegiance to the Rightful King, when his Throne is in the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of an U≈øurper, that they would not have taken the ≈øame care in this, as they do in the other Examples, and plainly and clearly have ≈øaid, that the practice of <hi>Jehoiada</hi> and the People was not <hi>Now</hi> to be drawn into pre≈øident; for certainly, there is not le≈øs, but a great deal more Rea≈øon, to believe, that men may think it their duty, to own Allegiance to a di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed King, as the People of <hi>Judah</hi> did, than to kill a Lawful King, as <hi>Ahud</hi> did; and to ≈øeek no further, ≈øuch a man as Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> being ≈øo long before he could per≈øwade him≈øelf to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is a demon≈øtrative Evidence of it; and con≈øequently it required yet the greater Caution to prevent it.

And I believe, no good rea≈øon can be given, why the Convocation ≈øhould be ≈øo very expre≈øs and particular in Cautioning again≈øt Re≈øi≈øting and Killing of Kings, from tho≈øe other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; and yet give no manner of Caution again≈øt Depo≈øing and Killing an U≈øurper, from this Example; except they thought <hi>tho≈øe</hi> were not exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but <hi>this</hi> was. And let any man con≈øider the Method the Convocation u≈øes, and he will certainly find, that when ever they mention any Examples, which are not to be drawn into Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in Succeeding Ages, they plainly declare ≈øo, with all po≈ø≈øible Indu≈øtry and Caution: And their not doing ≈øo here, and e≈øpecially having from this very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample caution'd again≈øt Depo≈øing a Rightful King; it is a plain proof, that they did not think, that this Example of <hi>Jehoiada</hi> and the People of <hi>Judah,</hi> was an Example of that kind; but might ≈øo far as they ju≈øtifie it, be drawn into practice. And this I think (if men

The Dr. indeed hath made ≈øome difficulty of that, but the Convocation thought of none, they plainly and roundly a≈ø≈øert it was lawful and their duty ≈øo to do? The difficulty of the High Prie≈øts Authority to depo≈øe a King they obviate, and that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon depos'd was an U≈øurper, and what he did was as a Subject, and not as High Prie≈øt; but they make no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of difficulty, of their <hi>yielding ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to their lawful King,</hi> and then depo≈øing the U≈øurper: And I believe any man that attentively con≈øiders what the Convocation ≈øay in this Chapter and Canon, will find that that is the main, if not the only ground of their An≈øwer, that becau≈øe it was lawful, and a duty for Subjects to yield their Subjection and Allegiance to their Lawful King; therefore what <hi>Jehoiada</hi> did in ≈øetting him up, and depo≈øing the U≈øurper, was not peculiar to his office of High Prie≈øt, but as a duty in common to him with the re≈øt of the Subjects; ≈øo that they are ≈øo far from di≈øputing about it, or u≈øing any Arguments to confirm it, that they take it for granted, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon it, and ground their An≈øwer upon the ≈øuppo≈øition of it. But ≈øays the Dr. the Convocation taking notice that Jehoiada <hi>had acquainted them, that it was the Lords will</hi> Joa≈øh <hi>≈øhould reign over them, plainly refers to that Divine Entail.</hi> And this he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to prove more fully in the next page, but to ≈øave him any further trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I ≈øhall readily own that when the Convocation ≈øpeaks of the <hi>Lords will,</hi> and the <hi>Lords purpo≈øe,</hi> that <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> ≈øhould reign, they do refer to that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail upon <hi>David</hi> s Po≈øterity. And 'tis next to impo≈ø≈øible to think they ≈øhould do otherwi≈øe, for it was by virtue of that very Entail, that <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> had a Right to the Crown, and had there been no ≈øuch Entail, <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> would have had no more Right than <hi>Athaliah</hi> her ≈øelf; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mentioning of it was proper and nece≈ø≈øary.

For they ≈øpeak it in one ≈øen≈øe, and he in another, they ≈øpeak it without oppo≈øition to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Entails, and he purely in oppo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them; they urge it, and ≈øo does

And from hence would make his Reader believe, that they taught that in other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, where the Entails of the Crown are made by Humane Laws; the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ought not to ≈øtand by the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King, nor depo≈øe the U≈øurper, but ≈øtand by him and a≈ø≈øi≈øt him again≈øt the Rightful King; which is a wild and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant as well as a ≈øophi≈øtical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion; and any man but the Dr. would conclude the direct contrary; that becau≈øe in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> the Subjects were bound to own their di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed King, and a≈ø≈øi≈øt him in the recovery of his Rights, and depo≈øe an U≈øurper that wrongfully po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed his Throne; becau≈øe God by Entail had ≈øix'd and ≈øetled the Crown in one Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and by that had made the Right to the Government to be in them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in other Countries, becau≈øe the Laws had entail'd and fix'd the Crown in a certain Family, the Subjects are bound to do the ≈øame to their Rightful King; For tho the Entails be differing, the Rea≈øon and Equity of both is the ≈øame; the King of <hi>Judah</hi> had a Right to the Government by Divine Entail, and the Kings in other Countries by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Entails, but they both have right, and the Laws of doing Right are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and immutable; however the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and determining that Right may be various. And I believe the Dr. is the fir≈øt, that from hence made a negative argument, for tho there have been tho≈øe who have ≈øaid, the examples of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Obedience in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do not affect us; becau≈øe the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Con≈øtitution of the <hi>Jewi≈øh</hi> Commonwealth was differing, but to ≈øay that, becau≈øe the <hi>Jews</hi> were bound to ob≈øerve their Laws of Government, becau≈øe they were appointed by God him≈øelf; therefore the Subjects of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Governments are not bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve the Laws of their re≈øpective Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitutions, is a ≈øtrein beyond the Moon, and fit only for the Dr. when he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains paradoxes.

            <p>I had further ≈øaid with re≈øpect to the Convocation as the Dr. ob≈øerves, That <hi>they do not ≈øpeak of this</hi> (the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinctio between Divine and Humane Entails) when they call <hi>Athaliah</hi> an U≈øurper, and ju≈øtifie the proceedings of <hi>Jehoiada</hi> and the People again≈øt her; but the Rea≈øon they give is general, <hi>The Right Heir of the Kingdom being alive, which extends to all Kingdoms that are entail'd and go by Succe≈ø≈øion.</hi> To this the Dr. replies, <hi>that I make very bold with the Convocation, for</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>they do not offer to ju≈øtifie the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of</hi> Jehoiada, <hi>and the People again≈øt</hi> Athaliah, <hi>by ≈øaying that the Right Heir of the Kingdom was alive, but only prove by that She was an <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, who had no Legal Right to the Throne, the Right Heir being liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But if our Author will think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; I pre≈øume he will own that they are two very different que≈øtions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øuch a Prince be an <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper, and whether he may be depo≈øed and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</hi> In an≈øwer to this I have only the≈øe things to ob≈øerve.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That here is one point gained, and that is, that according to the Dr. The ≈øen≈øe of the Convocation is, that the Death of the Right Heir makes a <hi>Legal</hi> Right to the Crown to him that Po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øes it; for he ≈øays, that they prove from the Right Heirs being living, that <hi>Athaliah</hi> was an U≈øurper, and had no <hi>Legal</hi> Right to the Throne, plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that if he had been dead, ≈øhe had not been an U≈øurper, and would have had a <hi>Legal</hi> Right to the Throne; and he tells us that an U≈øurper is ≈øuch a one as hath no <hi>Legal</hi> Right to the Throne. And ≈øo the Dr. mu≈øt grant me that a <hi>Legal</hi> Right may be conveyed as well by the Death, as by the Ce≈ø≈øion of the Right Heir.

And then tells me <hi>upon the≈øe terms he may agree with me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 16.</note> whereas now he hath agreed the point upon my own terms; and ≈øo hath confuted all that he ≈øaid before; for if a <hi>Legal</hi> Right to a Government
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107829:29"/> by tho≈øe means may be acquir'd, if all the Governments the Convocation ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtifies obedience to, had <hi>≈øuch</hi> a Right, if all the Governments they ju≈øtifie the re≈øi≈øtance of, had not <hi>≈øuch</hi> a Right, then the di≈øtinction is between Right and no Right, and then by a thorough Settlement, they do mean the acqui≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Legal</hi> Right, and cannot mean u≈øurped Powers; which (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Dr. him≈øelf) have no <hi>Legal</hi> Right <hi>(if men under≈øtand them≈øelves)</hi> tho perhaps they may have ≈øomething or other no body knows what, by the Laws of Nature, Nations, or Force.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Dr. ≈øays, the Convocation does not offer to ju≈øtifie the proceedings of <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> and the People again≈øt <hi>Athaliah,</hi> by ≈øaying, that the Right Heir of the Kingdom was alive. Now the Dr. tells me, that becau≈øe I had ≈øaid this, I make very bold with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation; and I ≈øhall leave it with the Reader who makes more bold with the Convocation I that had ≈øaid they give that as a Rea≈øon to ju≈øtifie the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or the Dr. who ≈øays they do not: In this Chapter, after having recited the U≈øurpation of <hi>Athaliah,</hi> the pre≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Rightful Prince, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects owning, anointing him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing and ≈ølaying <hi>Athaliah;</hi> add, <q>in all the proce≈øs of which action, nothing was done, either by <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the High Prie≈øt, or by the Re≈øt of the Princes and People of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> which God him≈øelf did not require at their hands.</q> And to this they add immediatly, Joa≈øh <hi>their late Kings Son being then their only natural Lord and Sovereign, altho</hi> Athaliah <hi>kept him for ≈øix years from the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of his Kingdom.</hi> And if they do not give this as the rea≈øon of the whole, I wi≈øh the Dr. would tell me what they give it for. <hi>But</hi> (≈øays the Dr.) <hi>they only prove by this, that She was an <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper, who had no Legal Right to the Throne, the Right Heir being living:</hi> Now it is certain, that this proved her an U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; but did not the <hi>Divine Entail</hi> prove her an U≈øurper al≈øo? that ≈øurely is the direct proof of it, and the ground and rea≈øon why the other proves it. The ≈øame Law that declared the Right to be in <hi>Joa≈øh,</hi> declared <hi>Athaliahs</hi> to be U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurpation. And why I wonder, ≈øhould the Right Heirs being living any more declare, that She had no <hi>Legal</hi> Right to the Throne, than the Entail of the Crown did; and when his being alive, and being their natural Prince, declared it ≈øo only by virtue of that Entail. And I de≈øire the Dr. to tell me, how <hi>Joa≈øh</hi>'s being alive prov'd <hi>Athaliah</hi> to be an U≈øurper, any otherwi≈øe than that the Crown of <hi>Judah</hi> was entail'd on <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s po≈øterity. But then what means this trifling nicety? why truely the Dr. was afraid lea≈øt his beloved U≈øurpation ≈øhould ≈øuffer; And therefore adds, that <hi>he believes I will own that they are two very different Que≈øtions, whether ≈øuch a Prince be an <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper, and whether he may be depos'd and murdered;</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered is a very hard word, and I do not care to meddle with it; the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion calls it ≈ølaying, and I think (with the Drs. leave) there is ≈øome difference between ≈ølaying and murdering; and a little more than there is between the Right of an Heir, and the Entail that makes that Right. But to gratifie him I do own, that whether a Prince be an U≈øurper, and whether he may be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed and ≈ølain are two different Que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but I ≈øay likewi≈øe, that whether an U≈øurper may be depo≈øed and ≈ølain when the Right Heir is living, is but one Que≈øtion, and ≈øuch a Que≈øtion too, as the Convocation makes no difficulty to an≈øwer nor any Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And here I ≈øhall renew my reque≈øt to the Dr. and de≈øire him to ≈øhew me any one approved Author of any Age, that ever a≈ø≈øerted, that <hi>Tyrannus ≈øine Titulo</hi> might not be depos'd, or if he cannot do it him≈øelf, that he will reque≈øt that learned Pen he tells me of, that is to inform me of the ≈øen≈øe of the Primitive Chri≈øtians; for it is no great credit to this Doctrine, that it hath had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Patrons than <hi>Goodwin, Jenkins,</hi> &amp;c. and only trump'd up to ≈øerve the vile≈øt purpo≈øes; and from that time to this hath not had one ≈øingle A≈ø≈øertor, 'till it is now tran≈ømigrated to Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had further ≈øaid, that the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thought of no ≈øuch difference, but that a thorough Settlement of a Government, (and tho attained by the ≈øame ill means) was the ≈øame thing, and had God's Authority in <hi>Judah</hi> as well as any other Nation; as in the in≈øtances of the <hi>Babylonians, Macedonians,</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> who≈øe Government over the <hi>Jews</hi> was not attained by hone≈øter means than <hi>Athaliahs;</hi> and was as much contrary to the Entail upon <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s hou≈øe, as hers, and yet they ju≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and require obedience to them, but ju≈øtifie the ≈ølaying of her; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is plain, that by a thorough Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement they do not mean a full Po≈ø≈øe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of Power, [<hi>for</hi> (what the Dr. hath left out) <hi>Athaliah had as full Po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of Power</hi>] in the Kingdom of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> as had the <hi>Babylonians, Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> or <hi>Romans;</hi> nor do they reckon God's Entail upon <hi>David</hi>'s po≈øterity any ground of difference in this matter, for the Government of <hi>Judah</hi> by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> was as much contrary to that Entail, as the Government of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaliah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now</hi> (≈øaith the Dr.) <hi>all this is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer'd in one word, The Entail God made upon</hi> David<hi>'s po≈øterity did always oblige the</hi> Jews, <hi>when they were at their own choice, and had power enough to take the King, on whom God had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd the Crown, which was evidently their ca≈øe, when</hi> Jehoiada <hi>anointed</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈øh <hi>and ≈ølew</hi> Athaliah; <hi>but when they were under force (as they were under the</hi> Babylonians, Macedonians, <hi>and</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans) <hi>no Entail tho made by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf could bind them. And then I hope it will be granted, that no Humane Entails can bind any People, who are under force, if a Divine Entail can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I an≈øwer, This is no an≈øwer to the main point; the Que≈øtion is whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ≈øen≈øe of the Convocation, a thorough Settlement (by what means ≈øoever attained) did not oblige the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Judah</hi> to obedience as much as in any other Country; and tho con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Entail on <hi>David</hi>'s po≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and it is plain they thought ≈øo, for they urge the very ≈øame duties of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Non-re≈øi≈øtance to the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> as they do to the Kings of <hi>David</hi>'s Family. The <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> when their Government was throughly ≈øetled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, their Authority was as ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and irre≈øi≈øtable as <hi>Joa≈øh</hi>'s, or any other of their Kings who were ≈øo by the Divine Entail; and let the Dr. if he can, ≈øhew me any one duty of Subjects, which they require as due to the Kings of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> by the Divine Entail; which they do not al≈øo require as equally due to the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> which is clear to a Demon≈øtration, that they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107829:30"/> thought of no ≈øuch difference in this matter, but that a thorough Settlement in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> was the ≈øame thing, and every way as valid as in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Country. And the Inference is plain, that therefore whatever po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power <hi>Athaliah</hi> had, and whatever ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion there was of the People to her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>for that the Dr. is re≈øolv'd to ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe) they did not mean that to be the thorough Settlement, which has God's Authority, and to which obedience is due; for they urge obedience and non-re≈øi≈øtance to the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> but ju≈øtifie the depo≈øing and ≈ølaying of <hi>Athaliah.</hi> But to this (which is the main Que≈øtion) the Dr. ≈øays not one word, and all that he ≈øays is, that <hi>when they were at their own choice and had power, they were bound to take the King on whom God entail'd the Crown, but when they were under force, no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail tho made by God him≈øelf could bind them.</hi> And what is all this to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation ≈øpeaking of a thorough Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, without any re≈øpect to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Divine and Humane Entails? what if the Dr. (to ≈øave a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an≈øwer) has found a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>force?</hi> The Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion takes as little notice of this di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as it does of the other: But the Dr. hath an extraordinary faculty at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtingui≈øhing; when the ca≈øe of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> and <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> pre≈ø≈øes him, then he is for di≈øtingui≈øhing between <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane</hi> Entails; and <hi>Athaliah</hi> might be depos'd and ≈ølain, becau≈øe She was an U≈øurper again≈øt a Divine Entail, and her Government was a <hi>nullity</hi> when the Right Heir appear'd; when he is pre≈øs'd with the in≈øtances of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> who (according to him) were likewi≈øe U≈øurpers again≈øt the ≈øame Divine Entail, then he is for di≈øtingui≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>force, when they are at their own choice and have power, they are oblig'd to take the King by God's Entail, when under force God's Entail does not bind them.</hi> So that this la≈øt di≈øtinction hath eaten up the former, and the whole matter is re≈øolved into <hi>force,</hi> if they had power, then the Government of the U≈øurper was at an end, and a nullity; and they were bound to pro≈øecute and depo≈øe the U≈øurper: But if they had not Power, the U≈øurpers was a very good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ought to be obeyed for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience ≈øake. And ≈øo we are furni≈øhed with admirable mea≈øures of Obedience and Government, if they have Power they are bound in Con≈øcience to re≈øi≈øt and depo≈øe, if they are under force they are bound in Con≈øcience to ≈øubmit and obey, ≈øo that either way the Rule of Con≈øcience is not a Divine Entail, but only force. But then I wonder what the Dr. will ≈øay to that manife≈øt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that was between the U≈øurpation of <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and the Government of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Romans:</hi> They were plainly under force all the ≈øix years of <hi>Athaliahs</hi> U≈øurpation; and how came it to pa≈øs, that that would not make them Her Subjects, and her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as irre≈øi≈øtable as that of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? if force would do it,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 13.</note> why would not <hi>Athaliahs</hi> force effect it as well, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> or the <hi>Roman</hi> force? <hi>Athaliahs force</hi> indeed was the <hi>force</hi> of the Kingdom, and the <hi>Babylonians</hi> was a foreign force; but I ≈øuppo≈øe the Dr. does not care to make <hi>that</hi> a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and he expre≈øly affirms the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>for private Subjects, when the Prince and Government of the Nation is violently changed, and they are under force, force will ju≈øtifie ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, and then it is much the ≈øame thing from what quarter the force comes.</hi> And why then would not the force coming from <hi>Athaliahs quarter,</hi> do the ≈øame thing and take off the binding Power of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107829:30"/> the Divine Entail, as well as when it came from the <hi>Babyloni≈øh quarter?</hi> And why were not they <hi>Athaliahs</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as well as to the Kings of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and her Authority as irre≈øi≈øtable? The Nation, the Laws, the Entails, were the ≈øame, and there was force in one Ca≈øe as well as the other; why tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there was this difference that <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> was an U≈øurper, and the Kings of <hi>Babylon</hi> were none. And if the Dr. can find any other difference, he would do well to ≈øhew it.</p>
            <p>Well! however that be let us ≈øee what kind of Subjects this Doctrine makes of the <hi>Jews</hi> to the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> He tells us, <hi>Kings ≈øet up by providence in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi>

But tho the Doctor knows no more <hi>hurt</hi> in it, I hope he knows, there is a great deal of difference, for <hi>Baa≈øha</hi> was a rightful King, and no U≈øurper, and <hi>Athaliah</hi> was an U≈øurper, and no rightful Queen, and (if the Doctor plea≈øe) no Queen at all.

            <p>But (≈øays the Doctor) <hi>This he knew did not follow from my Principles,</hi> i. e. the Doctor did not ≈øay <hi>it was unlawful for</hi> Jehoiada <hi>to have anointed</hi> Joa≈øh <hi>and to have killed</hi> Athaliah.

            </p>
            <p>The Dr. proceeds upon my An≈øwer, and ≈øays that I ≈øay, <hi>By Government, he means, the Actual Admini≈øtration of it; and then Government and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance are ≈øo far from being</hi> ≈øuch <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives, that they are no Relatives at all; they are only the Acts of Relatives, and to ≈øay the Acts of Relatives are Relatives, is ≈øo far from being as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as any Propo≈øition in Logic, that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107829:38"/> it is Logical Non≈øen≈øe.</hi> To this the Dr. replys, <hi>Well! Logical Non≈øen≈øe I hope is the be≈øt ≈øort of Non≈øen≈øe how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi> Well! Be≈øt or wor≈øt, <hi>Non≈øen≈øe</hi> it is; and if the Dr. had rather have it of the be≈øt ≈øort, with all my heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>my meaning is plain enough, and certainly true; which is as much, as any Propo≈øition in Logick can be. By Government, I do mean the Actual Admini≈øtration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not as that ≈øignifies the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Acts of Government, but the Actual Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Govern. By Allegiance, I mean that Obedience and Subjection that is due to Government.</hi> Something is the matter ≈øure, that we mu≈øt di≈øtingui≈øh ≈øo nicely. I wonder what is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Actual Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power, and Actual admini≈øtring it: And if there was any difference, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he means now, in his <hi>Ca≈øe of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,</hi> he certainly meant the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtring, <hi>i. e.</hi> the performing the Acts of Government: for his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is,<note place="margin">Ca≈øe of Alleg. p. 42.</note> 
               <hi>If the Prince cannot govern, the Subject can't obey.</hi> And what does he mean by the Prince cannot go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, but that he cannot perform the Acts of Government, cannot exerci≈øe and admini≈øter it. And the ≈øame he means with re≈øpect to the Allegiance of the Subject.<note place="margin">P. 43.</note> 
               <hi>The Subject cannot obey: i. e.</hi> cannot actually pay his Allegiance. And this he mu≈øt mean, if he means any thing: And ≈øo he ≈øays after, <hi>He may have a Legal Right, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not actually have the Subjects Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, nor can Subjects pay him their Allegiance; i. e.</hi> cannot perform the Acts of it. I know there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Acts of Allegiance, and the Duty of Allegiance. A man may owe Allegiance, where he cannot pay it; and it may be <hi>due</hi> to a Per≈øon, to whom the Subject cannot perform the Acts of it. But this is ≈øo far from doing him ≈øervice, that it confutes his whole Argument: for what <hi>if when the Prince can't govern, the Subjects can't obey;</hi> yet if the Subject may <hi>owe</hi> the Prince Obedience, what if the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject cannot pay the Prince Allegiance; yet if Allegiance be <hi>due</hi> to him, the Drs. Argument falls. And what then makes him di≈øtingui≈øh thus Critically? Why truly, I had ≈øaid, <hi>That the Actual admini≈øtration of Government and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance are not Relatives, but the Acts of Relatives.</hi> And to be even with me, By Actual Admini≈øtration, he does not mean the particular <hi>Acts</hi> of Government, and by Allegiance the Duty, and not the particular Acts of it: And what is this to the purpo≈øe? Are they not the Acts of Relatives, for all that? What if <hi>Actual Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtration,</hi> ≈øhould ≈øignifie <hi>Actual Po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion and Authority;</hi> is it not an <hi>Act</hi> of the Relative, when it ≈øignifies ≈øo, as well as when it ≈øignifies particular Acts of Government? What if Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance means that <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which is due to Government,</hi> is not that an <hi>Act</hi> of the Relative, as well as when it means the particular Acts of Allegiance? Actual Authority is not the particular Acts of Government, but it is the Act of the Relative: the Duty of Allegiance, is not the particular Acts of Allegiance, but it is the Act of the Relative. And therefore let the Dr. mean what he plea≈øe by them, it makes no Alteration in the Ca≈øe. For either way they are Acts of Relatives, and therefore not Relatives them≈øelves. And this is the Single Que≈øtion, and I ask him, <hi>If the Actual Admini≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government ≈øignifies Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power and Authority to Govern, and Allegiance means that Obedience and Subjection which is due to Goverment,</hi> are they then Relatives? Why truly the Dr. cannot ≈øay that, tho he hath a great mind to it, but ≈øays, <hi>if the Author will be ≈øo ≈øevere, as not to allow me to call the≈øe Relatives.</hi> But the Dr. is mi≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107829:38"/> if he thinks I contend with him only about a meer propriety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion: For the whole ≈øtre≈øs of the Argument depends upon it. And if the Dr. mi≈øtakes the u≈øe of an Expre≈ø≈øion; and argues and builds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ≈øuch mi≈øtake, there is no rea≈øon to give up the Argument, out of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Expre≈ø≈øion. Relatives <hi>≈øe mutuo ponunt &amp; tollunt.</hi> But if the Actual Admini≈øtration of Government and Allegiance, are not <hi>Relatives,</hi> then they do not <hi>≈øe mutuo ponere &amp; tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lore,</hi> which the Dr. concludes from their being Relatives. And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he would have me give him out of good manners, for he hath not prov'd it, nor does he now directly a≈ø≈øert it: But (≈øaith he) <hi>they are the Relations which make the Relatives, and do</hi> mutuo ≈øe ponere &amp; tollere. Now if the Dr. can prove, that Actual Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power, is the Relation that makes a King; or if he can prove, that the Actual Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power (he adds indeed and <hi>Authority to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern;</hi> but if he means by that, more than Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power, he ≈øpeaks ambiguou≈øly, and ought to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd him≈øelf) and the Allegiance of the Subject do <hi>mutuo ≈øe ponere &amp; tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> I will not di≈øpute with him about Terms and Expre≈ø≈øions. Now to prove this, he asks, <hi>What is the Relation of a King to a Subject? His Dominion and Government. What is the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Subject to a King? His due Allegiance and Subjection: Then Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Government makes a King, and Allegiance a Subject; and Allegiance has as necce≈ø≈øary a Relation to Dominion, as a Subject has to a King: If there be no King, there can be no Subject: If no Dominion and Government, there can be no Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Paternity is the Relation that makes a Father, and Filiation a Son: and Paternity and Filiation have as mutual and nece≈ø≈øary re≈øpect to each other, as Father and Son. The≈øe are call'd by Logicians Relative Acts: i. e.</hi> Logicians call Paternity and Filiation, <hi>Relative Acts:</hi> This is extraordinary, and the Dr. would have done well, to have told us, who tho≈øe Logicians are that call them ≈øo. <hi>Relations</hi> I know, they are call'd; but <hi>Relations</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Acts</hi> are two things. But for all that, the Dr. proceeds upon it, and asks, <hi>Why then may not I call Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Subjection Relative Duties?</hi> He may call them ≈øo if he plea≈øe; but if he has no better Authority for it, than that Logicians call Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity and Filiation Relative Acts, he has none at all. But ≈øaith he, <hi>by which I explain'd what I mean't by Relatives.</hi> The Dr. call'd Government and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance Relatives;<note place="margin">Ca≈øe of Alleg. p. 42.</note> and argued upon the ≈øuppo≈øition, that they were Relatives; and from thence draw'd a peremptory Conclu≈øion, and ≈øaid, <hi>This is as certain as any Propo≈øition in Logick; and to extend Allegiance beyond the actual admini≈øtration of Government, is to pre≈øerve a</hi> Relative <hi>without its</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relate: <hi>for when one of the</hi> Relatives <hi>is lo≈øt, the</hi> Relation <hi>is de≈øtroy'd.</hi> And I hope no body will be ≈øo ob≈øtinate, as to ≈øay, that by <hi>Relatives,</hi> the Dr. meant <hi>Relatives;</hi> but that he meant <hi>Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> or <hi>Relative Acts,</hi> or <hi>Relative Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> or any thing rather than <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;</hi> for by <hi>Government and Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> being <hi>Relative Duties,</hi> the Dr. had explain'd what he meant by <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; i. e.</hi> he had ≈øaid Government and Allegiance were <hi>Relatives,</hi> and they are not <hi>Relatives,</hi> And can any body believe the Dr. ≈øhould mean things are, what they are not, tho he ≈øays ≈øo over and over: For this is all his Explication, He <hi>was</hi> ≈øpeaking of Government and Subjection, but he was ≈øpeaking of them as <hi>Relatives,</hi> and affirm'd them ≈øo to be, but ≈øeeing they are not ≈øo, therefore when he calls them ≈øo, he does not mean what he calls
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107829:39"/> them, but ≈øomething el≈øe: Now is it not a thou≈øand times better ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly to own the mi≈øtake of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion, than to be put upon ≈øuch ≈øhifts to di≈øgui≈øe it; and then to colour the matter the better, to laugh away the notice of it; as the Dr. very grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>This I'm ≈øure, is only a Logical Banter, and ≈øo let it pa≈øs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well! but the Dr. hath explain'd him≈øelf now; and for once let us take a new account for an explication, and ≈øee whether he hath mended the matter; but here we are at ≈øome lo≈øs, in the <hi>Ca≈øe of Allegiance,</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Allegiance were <hi>Relatives,</hi> but in the <hi>Vindication</hi> (by way of Explication) <hi>they are the Relations that make the Relatives;</hi> and a few lines after, they are <hi>Relative Duties;</hi> and a little after,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 11.</note> they are <hi>Relations</hi> again. I remember the Dr. told me, <hi>I blunder'd for want of clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinct notions of what I wrote.</hi> But mocking is catching: And here the Dr. <hi>blunders</hi> to ≈øome purpo≈øe, if ≈øpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confu≈øedly, backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be blundering, and all for want of <hi>having,</hi> or for want of <hi>laying down</hi> clear and di≈øtinct notions of what <hi>he</hi> writes. For as to Government and Subjection being <hi>Relative Duties,</hi> I doubt he mu≈øt explain him≈øelf again. For <hi>Duties</hi> it ≈øeems they are, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire to know what <hi>Duties?</hi> Are they the <hi>Duties</hi> of <hi>Relations?</hi> If not, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire the Dr. in his next, to tell me what <hi>Duties</hi> they are: but if they are, then they are not the <hi>Relations</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, but ≈øuch as flow from the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this is a plain contradiction to what he a≈ø≈øerts before, that <hi>they are the Relations that make the Relatives.</hi> But truth will out: And this is the plain ≈øtate of the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>≈øe; for it is certain they are <hi>duties,</hi> and <hi>relative duties</hi> too, in the ≈øen≈øe tho≈øe words are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taken; that is, ≈øuch duties as ari≈øe from <hi>Relation,</hi> and are due to <hi>Relatives,</hi> And this plainly confutes the Drs. no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and arguments, for then they are not nor can be the Relations that make the Relatives; for the duty flowing from the Relation, and the Relation it ≈øelf are two very different things; not do they <hi>mutuo ≈øe ponere &amp; tollere;</hi> for the failure of the actual duties of the Relative does not de≈øtroy the Relation. And this is the Drs. fundamental mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtake, he confounds the Relation with the duty of that Relation, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he a≈ø≈øerts,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the actual Admini≈øtration of Government, as that ≈øignifies the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power and Authority to govern: And Allegiance as it means that Obedience and Subjection which is due to Government, are the Relations which make the Relatives,</hi> and do mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuo ≈øe ponere &amp; tollere. <hi>For what is the Relation of a King to a Subject? His Dominion and Government; what is the Relation of a Subject to a King? his due Allegiance and Subjection; then Dominion and Government makes a King, and Allegiance a Subject; and Allegiance has as nece≈ø≈øary a Relation to Dominion, as a Subject has to a King,</hi> &amp;c. In an≈øwer to this I have the≈øe things to ob≈øerve.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is an illogical, and prepo≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous way of arguing, 'tis <hi>notum per ignotius,</hi> the Relatives are well enough known, but the Relations between the Relatives being ab≈øtracted things, are not ≈øo ea≈øily, and in ≈øome ca≈øes perhaps not at all under≈øtood. The Relatives Father and Son all men under≈øtand, and that there is a Relation between them; but there are not many, that have any formal Conception of Paternity and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; the Relatives Husband and Wife are evident enough, but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations between them are not ≈øo; and for ought I know have not a name in any Language; and if they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed very few would be the wi≈øer, who notwith≈øtanding would know well
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107829:39"/> enough, that there was a Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. And the Ca≈øe is the ≈øame with re≈øpect to King and Subject, and the Relations between them; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives are plain and obvious, and well known, but the Relations are ab≈øtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things, and not ≈øo di≈øtinctly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: And this is the rea≈øon, why ≈øeveral Relations have no names, and cannot be expre≈ø≈øed without difficulty and artificial explication. And hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men have not been very inqui≈øitive about them, and there was no rea≈øon for it, as an≈øwering no end, or no good end, either a fruitle≈øs curio≈øity or wor≈øe, to evade a Duty and perplex plain things. For the Relation is in≈øeparable from the Relative; and when you have found the Relative, you have found the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where a King is there is the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a King, and where is a Subject there is the Relation of a Subject; it would be a wi≈øe cour≈øe, for a Son to ≈øeek his Father, by inquiring into the Relation of Paternity, or a Wife her Husband, by inquiring into the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Husband; at this rate we ≈øhould ≈øoon have a mad World on't, and we ≈øhould have as dutiful Children, and obedient Wives as we have Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: And this it ≈øeems plea≈øes the Dr. be≈øt, he is for ≈øeeking the Sun in the dark, and the Subjects mu≈øt find out their King by the Relations, which is the back≈øide of an Argument, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at the wrong end. In the <hi>Ca≈øe of Allegiance</hi> the Dr. urg'd, that <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Allegiance were Relatives, and did</hi> mutuo ≈øe ponere &amp; tollere. And the Argument was proper and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical, if he could but have prov'd it; but when that would not do, then he is for a new ≈øtrein, and contrary to all methods of argumentation, is for prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bu≈øine≈øs by Relations, and would feign know, whether the <hi>Relative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues when the Relation is de≈øtroyed.</hi> And this is the difference between the Dr. before, and now, in his Ca≈øe of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, <hi>the Relation cea≈øed with the Relative,</hi> but in the Vindication <hi>the Relative cea≈øes with the Relation,</hi> that is, becau≈øe a direct Argument cannot do it, a prepo≈øterous one mu≈øt; and becau≈øe the notion of a <hi>Relative</hi> which all men under≈øtand, cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and intangled, the Dr. is for proving his point by <hi>Relations,</hi> which are not ≈øo well explained, nor put into terms, nor perhaps can be. The Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in all Ca≈øes are plain enough, but the Relations between them are not ≈øo plain, nor are capable of being ≈øo; and the Dr. thought it more for his turn, when he was beaten out of the plain road to take by ways; and according to ≈øome new Rules of Logick, to prove a plain thing, by an ob≈øcure one.</p>
            <p>And this is an an≈øwer to his Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion, <hi>what is the Relation between King and Subject?</hi> And <hi>let our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor think of any thing el≈øe, wherein to place this relation if he can, be≈øides Actual Dominion, and Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on the one hand to make a King, and the obligations to Subjection and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance on the other hand to make a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi> And what if I could not think of any thing el≈øe? nor of that neither? do Relatives cea≈øe to be Relatives, or mu≈øt the Corrolate go round about the wood to look for his Relative, becau≈øe he cannot expre≈øly name the relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. There is a Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Husband and Wife, Ma≈øter and Servant; and when he tells me what is the Relation between the≈øe Relatives, it will be time enough to an≈øwer him, and when he an≈øwers that he will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer him≈øelf; what is the Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Husband and Wife; why truly if the Dr. will expre≈øs it Logically, it is (in fine language) <hi>Husbandhood</hi> and <hi>Wife≈øhip.</hi> And ≈øo by way of Logical Argument, if the Relation of <hi>Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> cea≈øes the <hi>Wife</hi> is gone. And it a man has a mind to prove, that a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or Wife, are or are not ≈øo related,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107829:40"/> he mu≈øt prove it for≈øooth from the <hi>Husbandhood</hi> and <hi>Wife≈øhip,</hi> and then it is as plain as can be, and every body under≈øtands it; for the Dr. tells us ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Logically <hi>the Relative cea≈øes with the Relation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That Actual Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power and Allegiance, are not the Relations which make the Relatives.</hi> This the Dr. a≈ø≈øerts, and ought to have prov'd it, (for it is the foundation of this part of his di≈øcour≈øe:) But in≈øtead of that, he asks a Que≈øtion or two; <hi>what is the Relation of a King to a Subject? his Dominion and Government;</hi> (Actual Dominion he means,) <hi>what is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Subject to a King? His due Allegiance and Subjection;</hi> and ≈øo the matter is fully proved it is ≈øo, becau≈øe it is ≈øo; and this is very u≈øual with him, he takes for granted what hath mo≈øt need to be proved; and then builds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own ≈øuppo≈øitions, and rai≈øes the force of his Arguments from them. Here he tells us, that <hi>Government and Allegiance are Relations,</hi> and to prove this he turns it into Que≈øtion and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer, and in that form ≈øays the ≈øame thing over again; and then away he runs with it, and draws his Arguments and Conclu≈øions from it. And then <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion makes a King, and Allegiance a Subject, and if the Relation</hi> then <hi>of a King to his Subjects be Dominion and Government, does he continue a King,</hi> &amp;c. As if this was any more proved, when it was in the form of a Que≈øtion and An≈øwer, then when it was in a Propo≈øition: Well! tho he has not prov'd that Government and Allegiance are the Relations, that make the Relatives; he hath ≈øaid enough in all Con≈øcience to prove they are not ≈øo; for he tells us, that <hi>By Allegiance,</hi> i. e. the Relation that makes the Relative of <hi>a Subject, he means that ≈øubjection and obedience that is</hi> due <hi>to Government;</hi> that is to ≈øay one Relation is <hi>due</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, filiation is <hi>due</hi> to Paternity which is extraordinary fine. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he asks, <hi>what is the Relation of a Subject to a King? His</hi> due <hi>Allegiance and Subjection,</hi> and afterwards in the next page, he calls it, the obligations <hi>to Subjection and Allegiance.</hi> And are not the≈øe pure Characters of a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? it would ≈øound rarely to ≈øay the <hi>Duty</hi> of filiation, or the <hi>obligations</hi> of filiation. And ≈øo to avoid one piece of <hi>Logical non≈øen≈øe,</hi> we mu≈øt make 2 or 3. And here we are at a lo≈øs again, on one ≈øide of the leaf, the Relation of a Subject, is his <hi>due Allegiance;</hi> on the other, 'tis the <hi>Obligations to Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance;</hi> and <hi>due Allegiance</hi> it ≈øelf, and the <hi>Obligations to Allegiance</hi> are two things; and which would he have us take for the <hi>Relation,</hi> the <hi>Duty,</hi> or the <hi>Obligation?</hi> Allegiance it ≈øelf, or the obligations to it? And all this blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ari≈øes for want of laying down a <hi>clear and di≈øtinct notion</hi> of <hi>Relation,</hi> which is nothing el≈øe, but the re≈øpect the Relatives have to each other; and becau≈øe they have ≈øuch a Re≈øpect, thence ari≈øe the Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Relation of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is Paternity, that is, a Father is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to his Son by being his Father, for being the Father of a Son is Paternity: But Paternal Authority, or the duty of Parents are not the Relation, but re≈øult from it: The Relation of a Son is filia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is a Son is related to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by being his Son. And this is the ≈øame in all other Relations; as the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Husband and Wife, Ma≈øter and Servant, King and Subject; the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions con≈øi≈øt in the re≈øpect that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives have to each other; the Relation of a King to his Subjects is being their King: But Kingly Authority is no more the Relation of a King, than Paternal Authority is the Relation of a Father, but only re≈øults from his Relation, and is in nature con≈øequential to it. But I
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107829:40"/> expect the Dr. will ask me, what is the Relation of a King? But he knows well enough of the complaint of penury of words in this point; and that <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> ≈øays in ≈øuch ca≈øes, we mu≈øt invent words if it be needful to expre≈øs it. But it is all one to me, let him call it <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Sovereignty, Sovereign Power, Magi≈øtracy</hi> or <hi>King≈øhip;</hi> or what he plea≈øes, provided he will but ob≈øerve the≈øe two conditions. 1. That the meaning of them be not extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the notion of Relation, for they, and I think any other words whereby this may be expre≈ø≈øed, are words of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous ≈øignification; and as in one ≈øen≈øe they may mean the Relation of a King, ≈øo in another ≈øen≈øe, they may mean the acts or duties that re≈øult from it: Government may mean actually go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, and then it may be the Act of the Relative, or the Act of one that is not the Relative; but neither in one ≈øen≈øe, nor the other is it the Relation of the Governour; and if it means that, it is in an ab≈øtracted ≈øen≈øe, and is not to be taken for actual Government, actual Admini≈øtration, or actual Power: For no act or duty of the Relative can be the Relation; but only for the bare and naked re≈øpect of the Governour to the Subject; for Logicians tell us, that <hi>Relationes ≈øunt nudae formae per quas Relata referuntur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That they only terminate on the Relative, for the <hi>Relative</hi> is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the <hi>Relation;</hi> and the Relation is the Relation of the Relative, but of no body el≈øe, tho he ≈øhould ≈øtand in the place of the Relative; if the Dr. likes to call the Relation of a King <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> be it ≈øo, but then it is only the Government of the true King, that is that Relation, but not of another, tho he actually admini≈øters the Government of <hi>Sovereign Power,</hi> let it be ≈øo, but then it is the Power of the true Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, that is that Relation, not the Power of every one that gets into the place of the true Sovereign; Paternity is the Relation of a Father, but this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation can be extended to none but the true Father, what Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ≈øoever another man may get in his Family; the Relation of a Husband (call it by what name you will) is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to his Per≈øon; and tho another man cohabits with his Wife, he does not therefore ≈øtand in the Relation of a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to her, nor ≈øhe in the Relation of a Wife to him.</p>
            <p>The truth is, all the Drs. <hi>Actual Admini≈øtrations, actual Government, actual Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power</hi> are no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations at all, nor yet do they mean any thing, but as they proceed from the Relative. But if they proceed from any other be≈øides the Relative; they neither make, nor prove, nor are any ≈øigns at all of a Relation: Government is the Authority and Admini≈øtration belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Relation of a King; and when it is admini≈øtred by the King, 'tis valid and authoritative, and draws the Allegiance of the Subjects after it; but if it be admini≈øtred by one that is not the King, that Admini≈øtration does not make him a King, nor confer the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, nor make him ≈øtand in ≈øuch a Relation to the Subject. All Kingly Acts receive their force and validity, as they are Acts of the King, and not as Acts of Power; and the very ≈øame Acts done by another are nothing at all. Actual Allegiance or the ≈øame Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that is due to the Rightful King, may be performed with the ≈øame fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or with greater, and may be ≈øworn too, to one that is no King. But this does not make the Relation of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; at that rate a man may be a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject when he plea≈øe, and to whom he plea≈øe, and he may di≈øcharge him≈øelf as oft as he plea≈øe. And I wonder what rea≈øon there is why actual Government ≈øhould make a King, any more than actual Allegiance makes a Subject; for the Dr. tells us, the Relations make the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107829:41"/> Relatives, Government makes a King, and Allegiance makes a Subject: And if actual Government makes a King, then actual Allegiance makes a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; for according to him Allegiance is as much the Relation of a Subject, as Government of a King. This the Dr. ≈øeems aware of, and therefore ≈øays, 'tis the Subjects <hi>due Allegiance:</hi> But if it be <hi>due Allegiance</hi> that makes a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; then I doubt it mu≈øt be <hi>due Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> al≈øo that makes a King; and that is not meer Admini≈øtration but Lawfull Authority.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That actual Admini≈øtration of Government, or actual Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power, and Allegiance do not <hi>≈øe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuo ponere &amp; tollere.</hi> Here the Dr. tells us, <hi>They have a mutual and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary re≈øpect to each other; Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance has as nece≈ø≈øary relation to Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as Subject to a King; if there be no King, there can be no Subject, if no Dominion and Government there can be no Allegiance:</hi> By this he means <hi>actual Dominion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 38.</note> as he ≈øays afterward, <hi>where actual Dominion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cea≈øes, the King≈øhip is lo≈øt and the obligations to ≈øubjection and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it would be ≈øufficient here to turn the Drs. Argument, and Que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon him≈øelf, and to ask as he does, what are the <hi>Relations</hi> between actual Government and Allegiance: For it ≈øeems they are related as much as the Relatives them≈øelves. He tells us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that Government and Allegiance are the Relations between King and Subject. But I de≈øire to know what are the Relations between Government and Allegiance; for the≈øe it ≈øeems have a <hi>mutual and nece≈ø≈øary re≈øpect to each other.</hi> Now 'tis egregious <hi>Logick</hi> to talk of the Relation of a Relation; and this is <hi>Progre≈ø≈øus in Infinitum:</hi> For if there are Relations between the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then what are tho≈øe Relations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them? for tho≈øe Relations mu≈øt have <hi>as mutual and nece≈ø≈øary a re≈øpect to each other</hi> as the former Relations, and ≈øo on without end. And this is pure di≈øputing, and ≈øhews the vanity of ≈øuch new methods of argumentation; hitherto men have been ≈øatisfied, that the Relations are between the Relatives, and there was an end; but to talk of Relations between Relations is ab≈øurd and ridiculous, and makes the Que≈øtion everla≈øting.</p>
            <p>But as to the mutual being and cea≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of actual Government and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as to the rea≈øons again≈øt it, ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath been ≈øaid before, and more will be ≈øaid pre≈øently. I ≈øhall now on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øhew the ab≈øurdity of it from exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but it is ≈øuch a one, as evidences the fal≈øity of this a≈ø≈øertion, and the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy of the Drs. Rea≈øonings to ≈øupport it better than any Arguments or trains of di≈øcour≈øe. It is the Ca≈øe of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Martyr King <hi>Charles the Fir≈øt.</hi> Now if this be true then when King <hi>Charles</hi> was kept Pri≈øoner at <hi>Holdenby, Hampton Court, the I≈øle of Wight</hi> and <hi>St. James</hi>'s; He cea≈øed to be King, and the People of <hi>England</hi> owed him no Allegiance, nor were his Subjects. For I ≈øuppo≈øe, <hi>actual impri≈øonment</hi> is not <hi>actual Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power.</hi> And ≈øo it ≈øeems the High Court of Ju≈øtice was in the right, and they did not murder their King, but only <hi>Charles Stewart:</hi> For tho the <hi>man was in being the King was gone,</hi> and went away with his actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Power. And the Dr. afterwards, <hi>for when God has taken away his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he has taken away his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to govern; for God never gives the Civil Authority, without the Civil Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The actual Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power, and the Duty of Allegiance are Relations at lea≈øt; and (≈øaith the Dr.) <hi>if the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a King to his Subjects be Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Government, does he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a King, when he has lo≈øt his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Government, or do his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107829:41"/> Subjects continue Subjects when he cea≈øes to be King?</hi> And ≈øo by plain dint of Argument it ≈øeems King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Government was at an end ≈øome time before that horrid murder; and no duty of a Subject was owing to him, <hi>for one Relative cannot ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt by it ≈øelf without its correlate.</hi> Now the ≈øhort of the matter is this, either King <hi>Charles</hi> was King notwith≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his impri≈øonment; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding his being dive≈øted of all <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Power, or he was not, if not then the attempting his life what crime ≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver el≈øe it might be, was not Trea≈øon, nor within the Stat. of the 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. And the Indictment of the Regicides upon that Stat. was faulty, and they ought to be indicted, not as Traytors, but as Murderers. But if he was King all that time, then actual Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power, actual Admini≈øtration, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Government, and the Allegiance of the Subject, have not ≈øuch a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and nece≈ø≈øary re≈øpect to each other, as that the Allegiance of the Subject cea≈øes upon the Princes not being in the Po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øion of actual Power. Something of this I had ≈øaid before in the Ca≈øe of <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> 
               <q>That Allegiance was due to him before he actually admini≈øtred the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;<note place="margin">Po≈øt≈øcript p. 10.</note> nay, when an U≈øurper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually admini≈øtred it, and ≈øo it was to <hi>David</hi> when he fled out of the Country.</q> ‚Äî But the Dr. it ≈øeems would trouble his readers no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that ca≈øe. But here is another Ca≈øe, tho the rea≈øon be the ≈øame, and if he plea≈øe he may trouble him≈øelf to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer it, and acquit him≈øelf from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, that that Ca≈øe charges upon his Doctrine and Arguments.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, how is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he delivers here agreeable to the An≈øwer he gives, with re≈øpect to the times of U≈øurpation between 48. and 60. I had told him, that his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a Settlement would fit <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> and tho≈øe U≈øurpers; and tho he had mention'd ≈øome differences, yet they made no difference in the Argument. This the Dr. denies, and ≈øays they were not ≈øetled according to his account of a Settlement not having a national con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent; and therefore they might, or they might not ≈øubmit; it was lawful, but not nece≈ø≈øary nor matter of Con≈øcience, and they might be determin'd by their honour or intere≈øt; well ≈øuppo≈øe all this, and that tho≈øe U≈øurpers were not <hi>≈øo</hi> ≈øetled, were not each of them actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd of Power, Did they not <hi>actually</hi> admini≈øter the Government? And this the Dr. (in that very an≈øwer) expre≈øly a≈ø≈øerts, <hi>That the Power of the Nation was for ≈øome time in their hands:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 69.</note> And if it was in their hands then they <hi>actually po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd it,</hi> and for the time they po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd it, they mu≈øt (according to him) be Sovereigns, at lea≈øt Sovereigns of Gods making, and the Allegiance of the Subject was ≈øo long due to them. <hi>For it is as certain as any propo≈øition in Logick, that actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power and Subjection are relations, and have a mutual and nece≈ø≈øary re≈øpect to each other,</hi> and that <hi>Dominion and Government makes a King,</hi> But then what becomes of the fine pretences of Honour, Intere≈øt, and his notion of a thorough Settlement; for if the≈øe U≈øurpers were not ≈øetled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his account of a Settlement, they were po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of Power ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his account of Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power: And if <hi>Actual Government</hi> makes a King, <hi>Cromwel</hi> was a King, and had the Relation of a King; and the People were bound in Con≈øcience to ≈øubmit to him; and then I would feign know how the Drs. <hi>Honour and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt</hi> would excu≈øe them. Now tho the Dr. will not allow me, that his account of a thorough Settlement, fits <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> to all intents and purpo≈øes, his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtration of Government, <hi>fits him ju≈øt as if it had been made for him.</hi> Now (to ≈øay no more) this is as great a Reflection upon tho≈øe Worthies of our
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107829:42"/> Church and Nation, as I had charg'd upon his account of a thorough Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Well! but this I ≈øuppo≈øe <hi>is a prejudice and no argument:</hi> But I will tell him what is an argument, and directly again≈øt him; and that is, that his An≈øwer <hi>there</hi> is a plain contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all his Arguments and A≈ø≈øertions <hi>here;</hi> and I pray him to reconcile them. He hath given us a great many di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions already, but none of them will ≈øerve the turn; and if he plea≈øe to find out one more to make his An≈øwer there, and his Doctrine here to agree. For if actual Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power, and Allegiance have a mutual and nece≈ø≈øary re≈øpect to each other, let him tell me, if he plea≈øe, why the <hi>Rumps</hi> and <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels</hi> actual Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power, and the Subjects Allegiance had not as mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and nece≈ø≈øary re≈øpect to each other, as the Actual Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power by any other U≈øurper.</p>
            <p>The Dr. (by way of objection to what he had ≈øaid) ≈øays, <hi>All that I know that can be ≈øaid in this Cau≈øe (and which tho≈øe men mu≈øt ≈øay, who make Allegiance in≈øeparable from Right) is only this, that the Relation continues as long as the</hi> fundamentum Relatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, <hi>that whereon the Relation is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed continues, and that being a Legal Right, while this Right remains, ≈øuch a Legal King, tho he be fallen from Power is King ≈øtill, and Subjects are Subjects ≈øtill, and owe Allegiance to him.</hi> By this time, I ≈øuppo≈øe, the Dr. may <hi>know that ≈øomething el≈øe may be ≈øaid in this Cau≈øe:</hi> And I know no manner of nece≈ø≈øity why we mu≈øt ≈øay ≈øo now; for the ≈øingle que≈øtion is whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Actual Government and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, are the Relations that make the Relatives, and do <hi>mutuo ≈øe ponere &amp; tollere:</hi> And this may be ≈øufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd without mingling the <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum Relationis</hi> in the di≈øpute. But this objection he made for his own ≈øake; and tho it be not needful for us to ≈øay, <hi>that the Relation continues, as long as the</hi> Fundamentum Relationis <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,</hi> it was very needful for him to ≈øay ≈øo. And it is the very an≈øwer he gives, to what I ≈øaid to prove,<note place="margin">P. 40.</note> that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Government and Allegiance do not <hi>mutuo ≈øe ponere &amp; tollere, if a Subject be taken captive, or otherwi≈øe hindred from paying actual Allegiance, is the Relation lo≈øt, and does he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore immediatly cea≈øe to be a Subject? And therefore neither doth a King, if he be hindred from the Actual Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtration of Government, cea≈øe to be a King; but hath the ≈øame Right to our Allegiance in, and out of Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> To this the Dr. replies, <hi>the≈øe two ca≈øes are not parallel, in the fir≈øt ca≈øe, tho the Subject is taken captive; yet</hi> the Foundation of the Relation is not de≈øtroy'd, <hi>for his Prince is on his Throne ≈øtill in the Actual Admini≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government, tho he be violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly torn from him, ≈øo that his Relation may continue, becau≈øe he has a Prince to whom he is related. But when the Prince is fallen from his Kingdom and Power,</hi> the Foundation of the Relation <hi>is at pre≈øent de≈øtroy'd.</hi> And now we ≈øee the meaning of the Drs. objection, which was not to an≈øwer an objection of ours which we never made, nor need to make, but to prepare an An≈øwer to an Argument, which otherwi≈øe he could not An≈øwer. But for all this artifice he mu≈øt have a good hand at reconciling contradictions, that can reconcile this An≈øwer with his foregoing a≈ø≈øertions. The Foundation of the Drs. Argument is, that <hi>Government and Allegiance are Relations, and do</hi> mutuo ≈øe ponere &amp; tollere; and then the cea≈øing of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance de≈øtroys the Relation of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as much as the cea≈øing of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment de≈øtroys the Relation of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance; and when a Subject falls from his Allegiance, he di≈ø≈øolves the Relation of the Prince to him, as much as the Princes falling from actual Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107829:42"/> di≈ø≈øolves the Relation of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. For this I take to be the meaning of <hi>muto ≈øe ponunt &amp; tollunt.</hi> But the Dr. what≈øoever he had ≈øaid the leaf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is now for making a <hi>≈øingle</hi> not <hi>mutual</hi> Re≈øpect of it: <hi>The Prince is in the Throne, and in the actual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtration;</hi> and therefore the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is the Subject ≈øtill, what≈øoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of his Allegiance, and that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing de≈øtroys the Relation between King and Subject, but the Princes lo≈øing actual Government; but then what becomes of <hi>mutuo ≈øe ponunt &amp; tollunt,</hi> and <hi>Actual Government and Allegiance, having a mutual and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary re≈øpect to each other?</hi> that is not for me to know, and the Dr. may reconcile it, and if he plea≈øe he may take his <hi>Fundamentum Relationis</hi> along with him to help him out. And yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all I mu≈øt confe≈øs the Dr. has given a very good an≈øwer; for he ≈øays, that <hi>the King is on the Throne ≈øtill, tho the Subject is violently torn from him, and the Relation may continue, becau≈øe he has a Prince to whom he is related,</hi> and this is certainly true. But then it follows, the Relation of a Prince may <hi>continue,</hi> becau≈øe he has <hi>Subjects</hi> to whom he is related, for <hi>mutuo ≈øe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunt,</hi> as well as <hi>tollunt:</hi> And if the Relation of a Subject continues, tho he be violently torn from his Prince, the Relation of a Prince continues, tho he be violently torn from his Subjects; for the re≈øpect is <hi>mutual,</hi> and the King hath no more Relation to the Subject, then the Subject to the Prince. But this ≈øame actual Admini≈øtration ≈øerves many purpo≈øes: In the Ca≈øe of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance it was a <hi>Relative,</hi> a little before it was the <hi>Relation</hi> that made the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and now it is <hi>Fundamentum Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationis.</hi> And what will it be next? In the <hi>Ca≈øe of Allegiance,</hi> it was <hi>as certain as any propo≈øition in Logick</hi> that <hi>Actual Admini≈øtration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Allegiance were Relatives, and did</hi> mutuo ≈øe ponere &amp; tollere three pages before it was <hi>as certain as any propo≈øition in Logick,</hi> that they were Relations and did the ≈øame thing; and <hi>now</hi> 'tis as certain as any propo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Logick, that actual Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtration does all the <hi>mutual</hi> bu≈øine≈øs it ≈øelf. And it is as certain as any Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition in Logick; that when men leave the plain and beaten paths, they get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a wood, and know not how to get out again.</p>
            <p>And now it is time to come to his An≈øwer; and when he had made us ≈øay what he pleas'd, and tells us moreover we <hi>mu≈øt</hi> ≈øay ≈øo, one would have thought that at lea≈øt he ≈øhould have an≈øwered that. But he will not vouch≈øafe any clear and plain an≈øwer to his own obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: For to a <hi>Legal Right being the</hi> Fundamentum Relationis; He thus an≈øwers, <hi>Now to ≈øhorten this di≈øpute,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 39.</note> 
               <hi>I ≈øhall only ob≈øerve, that a Legal He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Right is not the</hi> Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Relationis. And what then! <hi>Legal Right</hi> may be the <hi>Foundation</hi> for all that. There are different kinds of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Right,</hi> and an <hi>Hereditary Right</hi> is one; the objection is general of a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Right,</hi> and the An≈øwer is <hi>≈øpecial</hi> of one of the <hi>Species.</hi> But let us hear his rea≈øon, <hi>for then there would be no Foundation, for this Relation between Prince and Subjects in any but Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Kingdoms,</hi> and why ≈øo? are there no <hi>Legal Rights</hi> to Government in any but Hereditary Kingdoms? and may not an <hi>Hereditary Right</hi> in Hereditary Kingdoms be the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the Relation, not as 'tis <hi>Hereditary,</hi> but as 'tis <hi>Legal,</hi> and other <hi>Legal Rights</hi> be the Foundation in other Kingdoms?

For the <hi>Foundation</hi> may be one as 'tis <hi>Legal,</hi> tho divers as 'tis Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, or Elective: But (≈øaith he) <hi>there
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107829:43"/> are a great many ways whereby Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are advanced to the Throne, an Hereditary Right, the Election of the People, the nomination of God, a Divine Entail and Conque≈øt, which very much differ from each other;</hi> And what if they do differ in other re≈øpects: They may not differ as to their being <hi>Legal,</hi> for a Prince ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Throne any of the≈øe ways, or any other, may have a <hi>Legal</hi> Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of it; (And we are not now di≈øputing when <hi>Conque≈øt</hi> becomes a <hi>Legal</hi> Title) But <hi>if all the≈øe be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent foundations there mu≈øt be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds and ≈øpecies of King≈øhip.</hi> That may very well be though not becau≈øe the foundations are different in this re≈øpect: Different Laws and Con≈øtitutions may make different kinds of Government, though all the≈øe kinds are <hi>Legal</hi> according to the differing Laws of the re≈øpective Countries. And I wonder what the Doctor means when he immediatly adds, <hi>whereas the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between King and Subject is the ≈øame in all?</hi> Now he tells us, that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is the <hi>Relation</hi> of a King, and Allegiance the <hi>Relation</hi> of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and if the Relation be the ≈øame in all Countries, then Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Allegiance are the ≈øame in all Countries. And that is, that the Government and Allegiance in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is the ≈øame Government and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance with that in <hi>England,</hi> and both the ≈øame with that in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and all <hi>three</hi> the ≈øame all over the World. Now I always thought, that the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Government, and the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Allegiance were founded on the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Laws and Con≈øtitution; as the Government and Allegiance in other Countries, were founded on their re≈øpective Laws. And then the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Relation between Prince and Subject, is the re≈øpective Con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of each Country; which though they differ ≈øpecifically, as they are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Laws, yet they agree in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral as they are Laws. Now ≈øaith the Doctor, <hi>we mu≈øt find out ≈øuch a foundation for this Relation, as will ≈øerve all Sovereign Princes;</hi> very well! and here we have found it, and that is the Laws of each Country. But this will not ≈øerve the Doctor; and therefore he ≈øays, <hi>and that can be no other but the Authority of God, by which Kings Reign, and to which Subjects owe Obedience:</hi> Very well, and grant him that too, the Que≈øtion ≈øtill returns, Is the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God the <hi>foundation</hi> of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ab≈øtracted from the Laws of each Country, or annexed to them? if ab≈øtracted from the Laws, then Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Allegiance are the ≈øame in all Countries; for where the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Relation, and the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are the ≈øame, the Government con≈øtituted upon that foundation, and the duties flowing from that relation are the ≈øame likewi≈øe: But if they are not the ≈øame, as 'tis plain they are not, then whence ari≈øes the difference, not from the authority of God ab≈øtracted from Laws (for that is the ≈øame in all Countries) but from the different Laws; and then the Authority of God is the foundation of this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that Authority is annexed to the re≈øpective Laws of each Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; there is a plain difference in this matter all over the World; and Subjects in one Country are bound in Con≈øcience to ob≈øerve Duties of Relation differing to what Subjects are bound in another; and let the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor if he can give any other rea≈øon for it.</p>
            <p>The Doctor indeed tells us, that <hi>this is not always annexed to a Legal Right, but is always annexed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107829:43"/> to a full and ≈øetled po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne. No man can have God's Authority who has not the actual Power and Authority of Government.</hi> But this is <hi>gratis dictum;</hi> and if the Doctor will give me leave, I ≈øhould rather believe, that God's Authority was with King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second in bani≈øhment, than with <hi>Cromwell</hi> who was po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd of his Throne: <hi>for God's Authority is the Authority of Government;</hi> it is ≈øo, but it is the Authority of a <hi>Legal</hi> Government; illegal Government is no more God's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than Inju≈øtice and Unrighteou≈øne≈øs are God's Laws. But <hi>when Princes fall from Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> i. e. when they cannot actually go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, <hi>≈øo far they lo≈øe God's Authority;</hi> but that does not follow, for God's Authority is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd to the lawful Governors in and out of Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion; as it was to <hi>Joa≈øh, David,</hi> and King <hi>Charles,</hi> tho each of them was hindred from actual Admini≈øtration, by the re≈øpective U≈øurpers that po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd their Thrones.</p>
            <p>The Doctor adds, <hi>I grant in all other Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where the Relation it ≈øelf does not con≈øi≈øt in the Authority of Government, nor the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Relation cea≈øe by falling from the actual Authority of Government, the ca≈øe is different.</hi> What does he mean? That the Relatives, or (as the Doctor will have it) the Relations of King and Subject do only <hi>mutuo ≈øe ponere &amp; tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere,</hi> or that when the foundation of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation cea≈øes, that <hi>Relation cea≈øes;</hi> but it is not ≈øo in all other Relations: he tells us, that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is the Relation of a King, and God's Authority is the foundation of that Relation; and that when the≈øe cea≈øe, the Relation cea≈øes and the King≈øhip is lo≈øt. And then tells us, the <hi>Ca≈øe is different,</hi> i. e. to my under≈øtanding this ca≈øe differs in other Relations: now tho there is a difference between the Relation of King and Subject, and other Relations, yet as to their mutual being, and cea≈øing, there is no difference; and that I think is the Ca≈øe,<note place="margin">Po≈øt≈øcript p. 9.</note> and was the Ca≈øe I put, and which the Doctor here refers to. <hi>To ≈øay that actual Admini≈øtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Government and Alleg. are Relatives, is to ≈øay that the actual Government of a Ma≈øter and the Obedience of Servants are Relatives; ≈øo that if a Ma≈øter be ≈øpirited away, or taken captive, ≈øo as he can give no directions in his Family nor actually govern it, his Servants cea≈øe to be his Servants, and the Relation is extinct,</hi> &amp;c.

The Man is in being, but the Ma≈øter is gone.</hi> Now upon this way of arguing I doubt the ab≈øurdity will follow which I urg'd upon him before, that if a Ma≈øter, after his Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, return to his Liberty, and to his Family, his Hou≈øe and Family are be≈øtowed upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ma≈øter that will govern it, for they have nothing more to do with him; the Relation was only between his actual Government and their Obedience, and according to the Doctor in his new book, <hi>When the Relation is de≈øtroy'd the Relative cea≈øes.</hi> Now to evade this I ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe the Doctor ≈øays, <hi>The ca≈øe is different in all other Relations;</hi> for he immediately in≈øtances <hi>as between Parents and Children, Ma≈øters and Servants, where the Relation is founded in nature, or purcha≈øe, or civil Contracts under the ≈øuperior Direction and Government of the Civil Authority, tho the Ma≈øter of a Family, as he ≈øays, be ≈øpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, or taken Captive, his Servants, Hou≈øe and Family, do not pre≈øently fall to the lot of the next Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor, but mu≈øt be di≈øpo≈øed of by the Laws of the Country, and the Authority of the Prince; for ≈øuch private and peculiar Intere≈øts are ≈øubject to publick Laws and a ≈øuperior Authority.</hi> This is true enough, but no An≈øwer; for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent Que≈øtion is whether actual Government and Obedience be Relatives, or in the Doctors new language Relations, and do <hi>mutuo ≈øe pone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

And this is no more than the Con≈øequence of what the Doctor him≈øelf a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerts, for he tells us the di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed Prince hath ≈øtill the <hi>Legal Right:</hi> and if he hath the <hi>Legal Right,</hi> then the Law would re≈øtore him to the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of it, if the Law might take its cour≈øe, and was duly ob≈øerved. But (≈øaith the Doctor) <hi>The Authority of God is at his own di≈øpo≈øal;</hi> right, and ≈øo is every thing el≈øe at God's di≈øpo≈øal as well as Authority; and the Doctrine of Providence ≈øufficiently proves it. But that does not make every man's Hou≈øe or Family fall to the lot of the next Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor, but they mu≈øt notwith≈øtanding be di≈øpos'd of by the Laws of the Country. But then why does it make the Crown fall to the lot of the next Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor? Are there no dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Laws for that as well as for the other? The Doctor's Rea≈øon, <hi>When the Kings Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> i. e. his actual po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>is lo≈øt, there is no higher Tribunal to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to, but to God, who removeth and ≈øetteth up Kings,</hi> is fallacious; for the Law is to be <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd</hi> to, which determines the Rights of Kings, and ≈øecures them too, as well as the Rights of the Subject. <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York appeal'd</hi> to the Laws, to make good his Right again≈øt <hi>Henry</hi> 6. and the Laws carried it again≈øt the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor.

The Law makes a Right, and every per≈øon within the compa≈øs and extent of tho≈øe Laws is bound to oppo≈øe it; but any body el≈øe, who is out of the bounds and power of the Law, may hone≈øtly effect it: in ≈øhort, it is ≈øuch a legal Right, which is under the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of foreign force, but out of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, power, or obligation of the Laws that make it: it is ≈øuch a legal Right which ju≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies any per≈øon, who is not concern'd with the Laws, to e≈øtabli≈øh it. But tho≈øe who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the direction of the Laws by which the Right is, are bound to prevent it. And that is, it is a legal Riddle, which no body can expound.</p>
            <p>The Doctor goes on with his Que≈øtions, <hi>Or</hi> (would he prove) <hi>that the ≈øtanding Laws of every Country are the Rule for Subjects in ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up Kings, when it is their own Act and Choice, and who denies this too?</hi> Now I am not very well ≈øatisfied with the wording of this; <hi>Free Act and free choice</hi> in ≈øetting up Kings, is not very ≈øuitable to hereditary Kingdoms; and in the ≈øame manner he expre≈ø≈øes it a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>No man ever deny'd but that in making Kings, Subjects are bound by the Laws of the Land when it is their own free and voluntary Act.</hi> But ≈øuppo≈øing he means innocently however he hath expre≈øs'd it: This I ≈øay, if it be the Duty of Subjects, and they are bound to own their legal King, then how comes the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be their duty, and they are bound to di≈øown and reject him. Force I grant may ≈øu≈øpend a Duty, and hinder the performance, but can never make it none, or alter the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of moral duties. This is a pure account of a moral duty; it is the Subjects <hi>duty</hi> to own the King by legal Right when they are free, but when they are under force it is their <hi>duty</hi> to kill and de≈øtroy him. If it be a duty when they are free, how comes the contrary to be a duty when they are under force. The being free, and being under force, makes ≈øome difference as to t e actual performance, but none as to the habit and obligation; while the force continues the Act is ≈øu≈øpended, but the habit remains and the obligation conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues; and if it be a duty when they are free, 'tis a duty al≈øo when they are under force. And the <hi>free choice,</hi> and <hi>voluntary Acts</hi> the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ≈øpeaks of is no d fference in the du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107829:45"/> was due to <hi>Joa≈øh,</hi> and to <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, all the time of their di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, tho their Loyal Subjects, who were under the force of the Re≈øpective U≈øurpers could not perform it. The Dr. ≈øays, <hi>his Hypothe≈øis is not concern'd in this Que≈øtion.</hi> But I think it is, and that con≈øiderably: for if the Que≈øtion be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Subjects are bound to own and adhere to the King by Legal Right, when they are free, I would fain know how they become bound to the clean contrary, to di≈øown him, and reject him, when under force, how it is their <hi>duty</hi> in Con≈øcience to ≈øet him up when free; and their <hi>duty</hi> in Con≈øcience al≈øo, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy him, and kill him, when under force. But of this before.</p>
            <p>As to what the Dr. ≈øays, <hi>that no man ever deny'd, but that in making Kings, Subjects are bound by the Laws of the Land, when it is their own free and voluntary Act:</hi> I ≈øhall leave him to di≈øpute the Point with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention: And becau≈øe we are upon Que≈øtions, he may an≈øwer the≈øe Two when he plea≈øe: 1. Whether the ≈øetting up King <hi>William,</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> were not their own free and voluntary Act? And, 2. Whether it were agreeable to the Laws of the Land, or in the Drs. own words, Whether they made the Law their Rule? If he an≈øwers the Fir≈øt affirmatively, and the Second negatively, 'tis plain <hi>Satyr</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective</hi> again≈øt them; and the Convention, I ≈øuppo≈øe, will not take it well from him, as he ≈øays, the complying <hi>Nobility and Gentry will not take it well</hi> from me (<hi>p.</hi> 65.) if he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwers both affirmatively. His Hypothe≈øis of <hi>Illegal and <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurped Powers</hi> is a meer trifle, and ≈øhews only how the Dr. can di≈øpute about no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpo≈øe.</p>
            <p>The Dr. hath not done with his Que≈øtions; but hath three or four more, which I am not concern'd to repeat; nor can I gue≈øs for what end he made ≈øo many Que≈øtions, or any at all: He asks indeed, what I would prove; and then fills a whole Page with Que≈øtions. But he under≈øtands it well enough: for immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after his Que≈øtions, he adds, <hi>The ≈øumm of his Argument is this, that a Humane En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of the Crown, made by the Laws of any Country, does in all Ca≈øes, and to all intents and purpo≈øes, as much oblige Subjects, as a Divine Entail, which is only the Law of the Kingdom too: for the People of other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms are as much bound to ob≈øerve their own Laws, as the People of</hi> Judah <hi>were theirs.</hi> Now if this be that which I would prove, what need was there of ≈øo many previous Que≈øtions, to entangle a plain thing; and I own this is that which I would prove; only I except again≈øt <hi>his all Ca≈øes, and to all intents and purpo≈øes,</hi> which are his words and not mine; and I will no more an≈øwer for his ≈øen≈øe, than he will for mine: My words are <hi>as much bound,</hi> which the Dr. ≈øums up too; and adds, <hi>in all Ca≈øes,</hi> and <hi>to all intents,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as much oblige:</hi> whereas it is enough if they oblige <hi>as much</hi> in the pre≈øent Ca≈øe, and to the Pre≈øent purpo≈øe, without running any further. And I do a≈ø≈øert, that Entails of the Crown made by Humane Laws, do <hi>as much</hi> oblige the Subjects to own the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Rightful King by tho≈øe Laws, and to di≈øown the Authority of an U≈øurper, as the Entail of God upon the Po≈øterity of <hi>David,</hi> did oblige the Subjects of <hi>Judah,</hi> to own <hi>Joa≈øh,</hi> and to Depo≈øe and Slay <hi>Athaliah:</hi> and let us ≈øee what the Dr hath to ≈øay to it.</p>
            <p>He replys, <hi>The Di≈øpute in general, about the Authority and Obligation of Humane Laws, is very impertinent to this purpo≈øe; for no man denyes it.</hi> Very well: but I doubt they mu≈øt oblige as much, and in ≈øuch Ca≈øes only, as will fit the Drs. turn. <hi>But yet</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>we think Divine Political Laws, much more ≈øacred, and univer≈øally obligatory, than any meer Humane Laws, tho made by men, who have their Authority of Government, and con≈øequently of making Laws from God: and I believe the Author is the fir≈øt man who has equalled Humane Laws, with tho≈øe Laws which are immediately given by God.</hi> Now I thought the Dr. had ≈øome fetch in putting in the≈øe ≈øame <hi>in all Ca≈øes, and to all intents and purpo≈øes.</hi> But did I ever ≈øay, that <hi>meer Humane Laws,</hi> were as <hi>≈øacred</hi> as Divine Laws? but as to their obligation, the Subjects in other Countrys are <hi>as much</hi> oblig'd to ob≈øerve their Political Laws, as the People of <hi>Judah</hi> were theirs; tho the one is made by God him≈øelf, and the other by his Authority. And this for the Rea≈øon that I gave; becau≈øe <hi>all Humane Laws that are ju≈øt bind in Con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> And need the Dr. be told, what is the meaning of Humane Laws binding <hi>in Con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which hath an immediate Re≈øpect to the Law of God. And the formal Rea≈øon that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107829:46"/> Humane Laws oblige <hi>in Con≈øcience,</hi> is not, becau≈øe they are <hi>meer</hi> Humane Laws (as the Dr. hath a mind to phra≈øe it) but becau≈øe it is the declared Will of God, they ≈øhould be obey'd; and the obligation <hi>in Con≈øcience</hi> to Humane Laws, is re≈øolv'd only into the Law of God. And I hope the obligation may be equal with re≈øpect to the Law of God, tho the Laws them≈øelves are not equal <hi>in all Ca≈øes, and to all intents and purpo≈øe.</hi> And I wonder where is the ≈øingularity of a≈ø≈øerting this, as the Dr. out of extraordinary candor hath a mind to in≈øinuate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>the Di≈øpute between Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane Laws, and a Divine and Humane Entail of the Crown, are of a very different nature, tho they be both the Laws of the Country for which they are made: i. e.</hi> tho they are both Laws, and tho they both receive their binding power as they are Laws: and tho the difference the Dr. contends for, is, that the one is a Law of God; and the other is a Law of man: Yet it ≈øeems the Di≈øpute about Laws would not ≈øerve the Turn; and therefore they mu≈øt be con≈øidered not as Laws, but as <hi>Entails;</hi> tho I mu≈øt confe≈øs, I can ≈øee no difference in that: for if they are Entails, they are Laws; and they are Laws, as they are Entails. And I do not very well ≈øee how their Con≈øideration can be ≈øever'd, or what need there is for it. But for all that,<note place="margin">P. 43.</note> the Dr. tells us, <hi>it will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øily appear, if we compare God's making Kings by a Providential Settlement of them in the Throne, with a Divine, and with a Humane Entail. A Divine Entail is God's ≈øetling the Crown on ≈øuch a Family by the expre≈øs Revelation of his Will; and tho God ≈øhould after this, ≈øettle a Prince in the Throne by his Providence, to whom the Crown did not belong by this Entail, ≈øuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence will not ju≈øtifie Subjects, in ≈øubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ≈øuch a Providential King, when it is in their Power to ≈øet the Right Heir upon the Throne: for this would be to expound Providence again≈øt the expre≈øs Revelation of God's Will: But a Humane Entail, is only a Providential Settlement of the Crown on ≈øuch a Family; and what is ≈øe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>led by Providence again: for where God makes Kings only by Providence, he can unmake them by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence al≈øo, and make new ones.</hi> And what is all this to the Purpo≈øe? and what ≈øignifies this tedious Relation of his <hi>Hypothe≈øis,</hi> which we mu≈øt have at every turn? And what is this, to the difference of the di≈øpute between Divine and Humane <hi>Laws,</hi> and Divine and Humane <hi>Entails?</hi> All that concerns that, is that <hi>a Divine Entail is God's Providential Setling the Crown, by the expre≈øs Revelation of his Will: i. e.</hi> it is a Divine Law. And a <hi>Humane Entail, is only God's Providential Settlement of the Crown on ≈øuch a Family;</hi> and that is, he hath ≈øetled it by a <hi>Humane Law.</hi> And I would fain know, whether it binds as an Act of Providence, or as a Law. But it ≈øeems the Laws of Entail, are to be ≈øubmitted to, not as <hi>Laws,</hi> but as <hi>Providences.</hi> And if we mu≈øt talk in this Cant, I ≈øay, that a Divine Entail, is God's Providential Settlement of the Crown, by expre≈øs Revelation; that a Humane Entail is God's Providential Settlement by a Humane Law, but <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpation</hi> is a bare Act or Permi≈ø≈øion of Providence, and no Settlement of the Crown at all. And why does a bare Act or Permi≈ø≈øion of Providence, defeat a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Settlement by Humane Law, any more than it does a Providential Settlement by Divine Law? The Dr. ≈øays, <hi>what is ≈øetled by Providence, may be un≈øetled by Providence again.</hi> Very well, but then it is the ≈øame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Providence. The Dr. ≈øays, we mu≈øt <hi>not expound Providence again≈øt the expre≈øs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of God's Will.</hi> And I reply, we mu≈øt not expound a bare Act or permi≈ø≈øion of Providence, again≈øt a Providential Settlement by Law.</p>
            <p>But all this while my An≈øwer is not touch'd, which is <hi>that the people of other Kingdoms are as much bound to ob≈øerve their own Laws, as the people of</hi> Judah <hi>were theirs.</hi> God's Entail was the Political Law of that Kingdom, and a Humane Entail is the Law of other Hereditary Kingdoms: and the Laws of other Countrys oblige in Con≈øcience, as well as the Laws of <hi>Judah.</hi> And if it was not lawful to own the Authority of an U≈øurper in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> becau≈øe contrary to their Laws, and their obligations to them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ≈øo in any other Country for the ≈øame rea≈øon But here the Dr. ≈øhifts, and tells us <hi>that the Di≈øpute about the Authority and Obligation of Humane Laws is impertinent to the purpo≈øe,</hi> but gives no rea≈øon, except
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107829:46"/> his ≈øaying, <hi>for no man deny; it,</hi> be a rea≈øon; he ≈øays after, <hi>that the Di≈øpute between Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane Laws, and Divine and Humane Entails, are of a very different nature.</hi> And it may be ≈øo, or it may not be ≈øo, for any thing he hath ≈øaid (for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring a Divine and Humane Entail makes no difference in that particular) but this is trifling and amu≈øing, not an≈øwering. The ≈øingle Que≈øtion is, whether they are Laws or no Laws, and are to be con≈øider'd as ≈øuch; is a Humane Entail, the Law of an Hereditary Kingdom; and does it oblige as ≈øuch? Then if other Kingdoms are as much bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve their Laws, as the people of <hi>Judah</hi> were theirs, it plainly follows, that U≈øurpation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be admitted again≈øt a Legal Right in other Kingdoms, any more than it could in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah.</hi> But this is <hi>impertinent to the purpo≈øe, i. e.</hi> to the Drs. purpo≈øe.</p>
            <p>The Dr. goes on, <hi>This di≈øcovers the fallacy of what he adds, We do not oppo≈øe Humane Laws to God's Authority, but we oppo≈øe Laws that are made by God's Authority, and which are a Rule to us, to Providence, which is no Rule.</hi> Well! This I ≈øaid, and where is the fallacy? <hi>Now</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>I would ask the Author, whether the Laws of</hi> England, <hi>which entail the Crown, are not Humane Laws?</hi> To which I an≈øwer, yes: and moreover, they bind in Con≈øcience, with re≈øpect to the Laws of God. But I cannot tell what the Dr. will call them, whether <hi>Providential Settlements,</hi> or <hi>Providences:</hi> for it ≈øeems they have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the Peoples Subjection, otherwi≈øe than as they are <hi>Providences,</hi> and not as Laws backt with God's Authority. But (≈øaith he) <hi>if they be, I ask whether they do not oppo≈øe the≈øe Humane Laws to the Authority of God, in making Kings by his Providence?</hi> I an≈øwer no: for God makes Kings by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence according to Legal Right. But it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Que≈øtion, Whether an U≈øurper po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the Throne by Providence, be a King of God's making, or be made a King by God's Authority. And the Que≈øtion, as the Drs. puts it, is Sophi≈øtical: he mixes and confounds what ought to be divided, Whether Kings are made by God's Authority, and whether they are made by Providence, are two Que≈øtions, which he makes one; when Kings are made according to Legal Right, they are made by God's Authority; for the Laws have God's Authority: But that a Providential Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne is God's Authority, or that a Per≈øon ≈øo po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, is made a King by God's Authority, is that which the Dr. hath not yet, and I ≈øuppo≈øe, will not be able to prove.</p>
            <p>The Dr. adds, <hi>to avoid this, he will not call them Humane Laws, but Laws made by God's Authority.</hi> To avoid what? That Sophi≈øtical Que≈øtion before? I never ≈øo much as thought of it. And I do not ≈øee how I ≈øhould; for it affects nothing that I have ≈øaid. And now I do know it, I do not ≈øee any ≈øuch ≈øtrength in it, as will need any Art or Pains to avoid it. But to ≈øave him further trouble, I will tell him all the de≈øign I had in ≈øaying the Laws were made by God's Authority, was only to ≈øhew the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of Humane Laws, that they bound in Con≈øcience, and were a Rule to us, and which Providence was not: and therefore all the pains the Dr. takes to prove, that Humane Laws are not Divine Laws, concerns not me at all, nor the Que≈øtion: He di≈øputes only again≈øt his own fancy; and therefore I ≈øhall not trouble the Reader with that, but go on to the next.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Well!</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>but the≈øe Laws are our Rule. They are ≈øo, when they are not over-ruled by a Superiour Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 44.</note> 
               <hi>but that they may be by the Authority of God.</hi> Very true. But are the Acts or Permi≈ø≈øions of Providence, that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God that over-rules the Laws? Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Laws are under God's Authority, as well as Humane Laws, and may be over-ruled by him when he plea≈øe. But that is no proof, that Acts of Providence over-rule them. And the Que≈øtion is not whether God's Authority may over-rule Humane Laws, but whether by meer Providence he doth over-rule them: and till God doth over-rule them, they are our Rule. <hi>And the Providence of God is not our Rule.</hi> Well, this I ≈øaid: To this he replyes, <hi>if by this he means, we mu≈øt not make Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the Rule of Good and Evil to us,</hi> i. e. <hi>that we mu≈øt not think it lawful for us to do what ever the Providence of God does, I grant it: For the Laws of God are the Rules of Good and Evil, not his Providence:</hi> Very well; <hi>We mu≈øt not think it lawful to do what≈øoever the Providence of God does:</hi> but
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107829:47"/> may we think it lawful to do <hi>any thing</hi> that the Providence of God does, as it is meerly an Act of Providence, in oppo≈øition to a plain and known Rule, allow'd and authoriz'd by God him≈øelf, as is the Ca≈øe of Humane Laws? This is the ≈øingle point: But let us ≈øee what a kind of Rule the Dr. makes of Providence. <hi>But</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>if he means the Providence of God cannot direct our duty, cannot lay ≈øome new obligations on us, and di≈øcharge the old ones, this is manife≈øtly fal≈øe in a thou≈øand in≈øtances.</hi> What does Providence do this as a <hi>Rule?</hi> That is the Que≈øtion: And I doubt to make it out, that we mu≈øt have a new no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Rule,</hi> as we have had of Providence, and a through Settlement: What if Providence direct our duty? it does not make it; but the duty is to be mea≈øured by the Rule, and not by Providence. What if Providence layes new obligations on us, and di≈øcharges the old ones? the obligation and the di≈øcharge too, are to be taken from the Rule, and not from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; and we are not to practi≈øe by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but by the Rule. And if Providence be contrary to the Rule, <hi>it directs no duty, nor lays any new obligations, nor di≈øcharges the old ones,</hi> Except it be quite contrary to the Drs. meaning; if a man by Providence u≈øurps another mans po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, all the Duty Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence directs to, and all the obligation it lays, is to have ju≈øtice done, and the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtor'd to the right owner. So that I doubt the Drs. <hi>thou≈øand in≈øtances</hi> will come very ≈øhort; and what are tho≈øe In≈øtances? <hi>Every new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition Providence puts us in, every new Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it creates, it requires ≈øome duties, and lays ≈øome new obligations on us.</hi> And what then? Is Providence the Rule of tho≈øe duties, or tho≈øe obligations? This is manife≈øtly fal≈øe; or is Providence the Rule of that Condition, or of that new Relation? This is manife≈øtly fal≈øe al≈øo: Suppo≈øe Providence puts a man into a ≈øtate of ≈øufferings, or into a ≈øtate of plenty, or any other ≈øtate; the ju≈øtice or inju≈øtice of the≈øe ≈øufferings, or pro≈øperity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not to be mea≈øur'd from Providence, but from ≈øome other Rule. Man and Wife come together by Providence, but whether they are related, and a relation is thereby contracted, is not to be known by Providence, but by the Rule that directs and appoints that Relation. But if a Man and Woman come together, but not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to God's Ordinance, they are not Man and Wife, nor is there any ≈øuch relation between them; tho one is by Providence, as well as the other: from whence nothing is more plain, than that Providence is no Rule in ≈øuch ca≈øes, nor is any Relation to be known meerly from Providence, but from ≈øome other Rule. And this ≈øhews the fallacy of what follows: <hi>I ≈øhall in≈øtance</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>only in the Ca≈øe before us, if the Providence of God can remove one King, and ≈øet up another, this does not alter the duty of Subjects to their Prince, yet it changes the object of their Allegiance, as it changes their Prince, the Laws of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribe the duty of Subjects to their Prince, but the Providence of God makes him.</hi> Now grant all this, the difficulty ≈øtill remains: Is Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the Rule whereby to di≈øcover, whether or no the object of Allegiance is chang'd, or whether one King is remov'd from being King, and another ≈øet up? When a Ma≈øter is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd from his Family, or a Husband from his Wife, there are by Providence; but if it be not according to the Laws of God in one Ca≈øe, and according to the Laws of the Society in the other, the Acts of Providence are no Evidence, that the objects of the re≈øpective duties are chang'd, nor are a Rule for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants or Wife, to pay the re≈øpective duties to tho≈øe who po≈ø≈øe≈øs the place or ≈øtation of the Per≈øons ≈øo remov'd by Providence. But the truth is, all this is Ambiguous and Sophi≈øtical. God makes, and removes, and ≈øets up Kings by his Providence, and ≈øo he does Husbands and Ma≈øters. But every Per≈øon that po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øes the places of the≈øe by Providence, is not therefore a King, a Husband, a Ma≈øter, but ≈øuch only who po≈ø≈øes them according to the re≈øpective Laws and Rules that con≈øtitute and appoint them. And therefore altho it be true, that God makes Kings, Husbands, and Ma≈øters, by his Providence; yet it is true likewi≈øe, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons may by Providence ≈øu≈øtain the places of them, and yet be neither of the≈øe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Providence is no Rule, nor can determine our Practices and Duties; but in all ≈øuch ca≈øes we are to be judg'd by Laws, and not by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences. A Woman is not determin'd by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, whether a Man that co-habits with her, be her Husband; nor is a Subject determin'd by Providence, whether the Per≈øon that Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øes the Throne be his King, but by the Laws,

They are the Laws of Succe≈ø≈øion, which entail ehe Crown. And how does God ≈øettle the Crown on any Family by ≈øuch Laws? No otherwi≈øe but by his Providence.</hi> And <hi>an Hereditary King by Humane Entail, is as much a Providential King in re≈øpect of God, as the fir≈øt of the Family; and to oppo≈øe the Laws of Entail, again≈øt God's ≈øetting up a new King by other Acts of his Providence, is to oppo≈øe Providence again≈øt Providence,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now the fallacy and weakne≈øs of the≈øe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are di≈øcovered from what was ≈øaid before, <hi>that Humane Laws are a Rule of Practice, and that Providence is no Rule of Practice:</hi> and therefore Providence is not to determine us again≈øt the Laws, but the Laws are to determine us again≈øt Providence: nor does it make any manner of difference in this, to ≈øay, that the Laws were made by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the≈øe Laws, is by Providence likewi≈øe; and therefore to ≈øtand by the Entail again≈øt the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, is to oppo≈øe a former to a latter Providence. For is there no difference between Providence concurring to the making and e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhing Laws, which are Rules of Practice, and ≈øo warranted by the Law of God, and the bare Acts or Permi≈ø≈øions of Providence, which are no ≈øuch Rule, nor ≈øo warranted? So that (with the Drs. leave) the oppo≈øition is not between Providence, and Providence; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Rule, and no Rule: and (if we mu≈øt ≈øpeak ≈øo) between Providence fixing a ≈øtated Rule, and the bare Acts of Providence, which are no Rule. And here is the plain fallacy of his Argument; it is true, the Laws of Entail were made by the Providence of God; but they do not receive their binding power, and oblige the Con≈øcience, from Providence, but from the Law of God. Providence concurred to the making them Laws, but the Law of God makes them obligatory.

            <p>To this the Dr. replies; <hi>The fundamental mi≈øtake, which runs through all tho≈øe kind of arguments is this, that they make the events of providence in private injuries, thefts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, to be the very ≈øame with God's di≈øpo≈øal of Kingdoms, and to have the ≈øame effects:</hi> Now who≈øe arguments are the≈øe that make the events of providence the very ≈øame in both ca≈øes? why truly the Drs. own, does he not tell us in his <hi>Ca≈øe of Allegiance, that the Scripture never ≈øpeaks of God's bare permi≈ø≈øi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

And if this be a mi≈øtake, then the Drs. Doctrine is a mi≈øtake, and his <hi>Fundamental Doctrine</hi> is a <hi>Fundamental mi≈øtake,</hi> and I cannot help that: And to mend the matter the Dr. hath gone one ≈øtep farther, <hi>and to have the ≈øame effects.</hi> And why not I pray?

The Doctrine of Providence affords us no difference, and God's Government equally extends to all Ca≈øes and Per≈øons: The Scriptures give us none, but equally attribute the depre≈ø≈øion and exaltation of private men to the Providence of God, as they do the ≈øetting up and pulling down Kings, and not one of the Drs. Arguments, ≈øo far as they concern Providence, but what are equally applicable to private property as to Thrones and Kingdoms: And let him di≈øprove this by ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any one if he can. But the Dr. tells us that <hi>All private injuries are re≈øerved by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to the correction, and redre≈øs of publick Government and Humane Courts of Ju≈øtice; and therefore his providence has no effect at all on ≈øuch per≈øonal Rights.</hi> Now this is true, and a good rea≈øon why the providence of God does not take effect again≈øt Legal Rights.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107829:49"/> Authority</hi> (which the Dr. intimates as a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon) does not prove it, for in all acts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, God acts with a <hi>Sovereign Authority</hi> if by <hi>Sovereign Authority</hi> the Dr. means act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing independantly, and without re≈øpect to the Laws and Rules God hath pre≈øcribed to others. This is the ≈øame in ca≈øes under the cognizance of Laws and Humane Courts, as well as in tho≈øe which are above them, and ≈øuch acting by a Sovereign Authority is no Rule for mankind, nor warrant for practice. But if by <hi>Gods act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a Sovereign Authority</hi> the Dr. means, That God as Lord and Proprietor of the World may di≈øpo≈øe of it as he ≈øees good, and actually does ≈øo in ≈øuch a way as may warrant practice, and confer a good Right and Title, as when he ordered the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> to ≈øpoil the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> This was an Act of Sovereign Authority, but cannot be called Providence, but comes under the notion of a Law, and they were warranted to take the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> goods not from provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence giving them opportunity, but from God's expre≈øs will impowering and authorizing them ≈øo to do. In like manner God may if he plea≈øe di≈øpo≈øe of Kingdoms, and private e≈øtates by his Sovereign Authority; but if he does ≈øo, he extingui≈øhes the Legal Right of the former owner, and conveys it to whom he gives it. And it can never be concluded that he does ≈øo from providence only, the ends and de≈øigns of which are my≈øterious and to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, but from ≈øome further evidence and notice of the Divine Will: But the Dr. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds God's providence with his Laws, and makes one a Rule of practice as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. God governs the World by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as well as by his Laws, but he hath not made his providence, nor directed us to ob≈øerve it as a Rule of life. And therefore the Drs. proof is prepo≈øterous, for although there are ca≈øes re≈øerv'd to Gods own judgment; altho God may act by a Sovereign Authority, that is nothing to his purpo≈øe, except he proves like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, that the events of providence are God's final ≈øentence; and that he would have the World take notice of them as ≈øuch. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead of that the Dr. is for beginning at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, and proves that God's providence is his final determination, and a Rule to be ob≈øerved, becau≈øe there are Ca≈øes re≈øerved to his own judgment: And therefore this proves indeed, that there is a difference in the two Ca≈øes, but does not prove, that there is any difference in providence, which is the only thing that needs to be proved; the one is under publick Government, the other is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly under the Government of God, but they are both immediatly under Providence: And a direct an≈øwer mu≈øt affect that, and ≈øhew how providence is le≈øs Gods Act, or a le≈øs Act of his Sovereign Authority, with re≈øpect to private Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions than to Thrones; how the ≈øame Providence, which in one Ca≈øe is Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to Laws, di≈ø≈øolves their obligation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels the bond of Oaths, and di≈øpo≈øes Crowns, in the other does nothing at all, but is under the Authority of a <hi>Ju≈øtice</hi> of Peace or a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtable.</hi> But this (which is the main point) the Dr. does not attempt to an≈øwer, but in≈øtead of that tells us, that in one ca≈øe, <hi>God hath erected humane Judicatures, but the other are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved to his own judgment,</hi> i. e. there is ≈øome difference as to the things but none as to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which is the only que≈øtion: For a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Judicature does not alter the nature of Providence; and if providence be God's <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, Order, and Council,</hi> then it is ≈øo notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding any humane Judicature; and it is ≈øomewhat ≈øtrange, that a humane Judicature ≈øhould determine again≈øt God's Orders, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees any more than humane Laws. And here I de≈øire to be re≈øolved in 2 Que≈øtions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How it comes to pa≈øs, that a humane Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory is a greater confinement to Providence than a humane Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether God hath erected humane Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories to determine the Rights of private men, any otherwi≈øe, or for any other purpo≈øes than he hath humane Entails to determine the Rights of Kings; and if not, then I ≈øuppo≈øe it will follow, that as humane Judicatories are a Rea≈øon why <hi>Providence</hi> (as the Dr. ≈øays) <hi>has no effect at all on ≈øuch Per≈øonal Rights,</hi> ≈øo hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Entails al≈øo will be a Rea≈øon why provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has no effect at all on ≈øuch Regal Rights, or at lea≈øt the one will be as good a Rea≈øon as the other.</p>
            <p>At la≈øt the Dr. comes to prove his point from the <hi>Poet,</hi> and tells me, <hi>The</hi> Poet <hi>would have taught him the difference between the≈øe two Ca≈øes:</hi> And I confe≈øs, I ≈øhould rather have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected this Doctrin in a <hi>Poet</hi> than in a <hi>Divine.</hi>

            <p>Now the <hi>Poet</hi> is not for him neither, for all that he ≈øays (as the Dr. quotes him) is, that the Government of Kings is over their own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and the Government of <hi>Jupiter</hi> is over Kings them≈øelves. And that he might very well think without the Drs. notion of Providence; and what opinion the <hi>Poet</hi> had of Providence does not appear. But however, tho this is not for the Drs.

            <p>The Dr. goes on; <hi>Be≈øides ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Principles,<note place="margin">P. 47.</note> Kings mu≈øt be throughly ≈øetled in their Governments, before it becomes unlawful for Subjects to di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øs them; and then if he will make the Ca≈øes parallel, be who unju≈øtly ≈øeizes another mans e≈øtate, mu≈øt be throughly ≈øetled in it, before it becomes unlawful to di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øs him, but that no private man can be, who is under the Government of Laws, who has not the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of his E≈øtate given him by Law; and when he has, whether right or wrong, he mu≈øt not be violently di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi> Now I crave the Drs. good leave, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn him one of his own Complements, is he in <hi>

The di≈øpute is between the Providential Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne, and of a private E≈øtate, now to make the <hi>Ca≈øes paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel,</hi> in the private Ca≈øe there mu≈øt be a <hi>Legal</hi> Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion; that is there is a Parallel between Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion and Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, but between <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential</hi> and <hi>Legal,</hi> which is the only thing in controver≈øie, there is none. We are not now di≈øputing about the notion of a <hi>thorough Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement;</hi> and for once let us take it in the Drs. ≈øen≈øe, and ≈øee what a fine <hi>Parallel</hi> he makes, a thorough Settlement of an U≈øurper on the Throne, is an actual and vi≈øible Settlement, not a Legal one; the Settlement of a private Per≈øon in an e≈øtate, is a Legal Settlement; and to make the Ca≈øes <hi>Parallel,</hi> one mu≈øt be <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> ≈øetled, not <hi>legally,</hi> and the other mu≈øt be <hi>legally</hi> ≈øetled: And ≈øo a thorough Settlement in one ≈øen≈øe, is <hi>Parallel</hi> to a thorough Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in another ≈øen≈øe; even ju≈øt as a <hi>Tryal</hi> of skill, is <hi>Parallel</hi> to a <hi>Tryal</hi> at Law, or the Drs.

But <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel</hi> is a term in <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> as Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a term in <hi>Law.</hi> But when they come to be apply'd to U≈øurpation, they mu≈øt change their ≈øignification, and mean the clean contrary. And there is all the rea≈øon in the World, for if U≈øurper ≈øignifies a King, why may not Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ≈øignifie Illegal Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, and <hi>Parallel</hi> ≈øignifie inequality? Now 'tis no marvel the Dr. tells his An≈øwerer, <hi>he expects to hear no more from him;</hi> for who is able to an≈øwer ≈øuch terrible arguments as the≈øe?</p>
            <p>The Dr. here tells us, that <hi>by his Principles Kings mu≈øt be throughly ≈øetled in their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments before it becomes unlawful for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øs them:</hi> Now I cannot tell what his Principles are, but this I can tell, that his Arguments prove no ≈øuch thing. I know in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that to get the <hi>Convocation</hi> of his ≈øide, he hath given us a new ≈øen≈øe of a <hi>thorough Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement,</hi> and that (as the chief) is the <hi>Con≈øent and ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion of the States and the great Body of the Nation.</hi> And when he hath done that, he takes his leave on't, for his Arguments neither concern a <hi>thorough Settlement</hi> in his ≈øen≈øe, nor in the true ≈øen≈øe: For what has <hi>God's removing and ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up Kings,</hi>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107829:50"/> Actual Admini≈øtration of Government, that he hath God's Authority; for that is a ≈øtrange Authority from God which the People may chu≈øe, or refu≈øe at their plea≈øure. But the truth is the Drs. notion of a thorough Settlement, hath rooted up the very foundations of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and plainly center in the Commonwealth Principles. And that is the bottom of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈øs, and for the proof of this I will be tryed by the Dr. him≈øelf. In his <hi>Ca≈øe of Allegiance</hi> di≈øputing again≈øt a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Right,<note place="margin">p. 25.</note> he thus delivers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf: <hi>To ≈øay that God ≈øets up no Prince, who a≈øcends the Throne without a humane and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Right, is to ≈øay that the Right of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not derived from God without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent of the People; for if God can't make a King without their con≈øent declared by their Laws,</hi> (and if the Dr. will give me leave, I ≈øay without their con≈øent declared by them≈øelves, or the States, or the great body of the Nation) <hi>the Authority mu≈øt be derived from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not from God, or at lea≈øt if it be God's Authority; yet God cannot give it him≈øelf without the People, nor otherwi≈øe than as they have directed him by their Laws:</hi> I add by their con≈øent; But what becomes of the Drs. thorough Settlement <hi>by the Con≈øent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> all this while, why it may be, he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got it: But however he tells us, that it is his Principle, and that may be too; but hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men u≈øed to bring Arguments to prove, and not to confute their Principles.</p>
            <p>The Dr. goes on, <hi>as our Author has ≈øtated the ca≈øe, it ≈øignifies nothing to the pre≈øent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, for whether private mens e≈øtates be ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a Divine or Humane Entail, it is the ≈øame ca≈øe if they ≈øuffer injury from their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Subjects, they mu≈øt ≈øeek for redre≈øs from Publick Government.</hi> That is, the ≈øaying, that the Land of <hi>Judah</hi> was entailed by a Divine Entail, as well as the Crown, is not to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent purpo≈øe, tho the great ≈øtre≈øs of the Drs. An≈øwer lies in the difference between a Divine and a Humane Entail And it is plain enough from thence, that a Divine Entail made no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as to <hi>Providence</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> between that and other Nations: But his rea≈øon is that private injuries may be redre≈ø≈øed by publick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; well! and that is a rea≈øon to prove that no providential di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of a private man, is any warrant again≈øt Law. But it is no rea≈øon to prove, that a providential di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Prince is ≈øuch a warrant, but the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for being above or under the Law makes no alteration in the nature of Providence; and it is odd to ≈øay, that Providence has power and efficacy in Ca≈øes where the Law has none, but has none where it has. But this hath been con≈øidered before; and as to the matter of God's ≈øetling the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> by Divine Entail: The Dr. after having ≈øaid, that <hi>he could have told me, how to have applied the Ca≈øe to the purpo≈øe,</hi> (and methinks he that hath ≈øaid ≈øo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the purpo≈øe, need not have neglected what had been to his purpo≈øe) ≈øhews ≈øome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> and other Countries: But tho≈øe are not at all to <hi>his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Canaan</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>where God allotted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very tribe and family their inheritance, none could pretend to a Right to any portion of Land, but what was allotted him. But in other Countries which were left in Common, Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion and Occupation gave a Right:</hi> Very true, but not when they were not left in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but property was inclo≈øed by Laws, Legal Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion then only gave a Right. But ≈øaith he, <hi>Thus in</hi> Judah <hi>none had an ordinary Right to the Crown, but tho≈øe that were nominated by God, or had the Crown de≈øcended on them by a Divine Entail. But in other Countries Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion and Occupation gave a Right to the Allegiance of Subjects.</hi> Now if the Dr. would have made this Parallel he ≈øhould have ≈øaid, <hi>in other Countries, where Government was left in Common;</hi> and then it had been true enough, for no body had a better Right; but it is not ≈øo, where the Crown is entail'd by Laws, Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion gives no more Right to the Crown, than it gives to private E≈øtates.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Canaan</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>when God had ≈øetled ≈øuch an inheritance in a family, it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be perpetually alienated, and tho it were ≈øold, it could be ≈øold for no longer time than till the year of</hi> Jubilee, <hi>when all e≈øtates were to return to their old Proprietors again.</hi> Right; and this was the Law of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and by virtue of that they did ≈øo return, but had there been no ≈øuch Law, would the Land-once ≈øold, have
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107829:51"/> then by virtue merely of a Divine Entail, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to their old Proprietors? <hi>But in other Countries men may part with their E≈øtates for ever:</hi> Right again, becau≈øe the Laws permit them ≈øo to do: But if the Laws of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, had provided that all E≈øtates ≈øhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their old Proprietors at ≈øuch a year, they would have done ≈øo too, tho the Provi≈øion had been made only by a Humane Law. <hi>Thus</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>in the Kingdom of</hi> Judah, <hi>tho God by his Sovereign Authority might ≈øet up a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential King, yet this did not cut off the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail; but whenever the true Heir, appeared, Subjects if they were at Liberty, were bound to make him King, and di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øs the <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper; but in other Kingdoms, a Kingdom may be lo≈øt, as well as an inheritance ≈øold for ever. Thus</hi> that is ju≈øt as an E≈øtate in <hi>Judah</hi> and other Countries, might or might not be ≈øold, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of each Country; in like manner, as in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Crown was not alienable, tho the E≈øtates for a time were, even ≈øo, <hi>in other Kingdoms a Kingdom may be lo≈øt, as well as an inheritance ≈øold for ever.</hi> And that is to ≈øay again, that as in other Kingdoms an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance may be ≈øold by the con≈øent of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties intere≈ø≈øed, even ≈øo a Government may be lo≈øt, without, and contrary to the con≈øent of the Proprietor, and right owner. For ≈øuch Parallels as the≈øe, <hi>otherwi≈øe</hi> or <hi>quite contrary</hi> might have ≈øerved, as well as <hi>Thus;</hi> The Dr. tells me what I ≈øay in this Ca≈øe is <hi>pretty,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe that between the Divine Entail, and Gods expre≈øs command concerning <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion by providence and a Humane En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail there is <hi>≈øome likene≈øs.</hi> I am ≈øorry I cannot return all his Complement, this is very <hi>pretty</hi> indeed, but there is no <hi>likene≈øs</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>We are come to the Drs. An≈øwer to the objection,<note place="margin">P. 48.</note> 
               <hi>that the Laws of the Land are the mea≈øure of duty, and Rule of Con≈øcience,</hi> &amp;c. and the ≈øum of the An≈øwer is, <hi>they are ≈øo, when they do not contradict the Laws of God, but when they do they are no Rule, but their obligation mu≈øt give place to Divine Authority, and ≈øuppo≈øe the Law ≈øhould forbid owning any King, but the Right Heir; and the Law of God ≈øhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand obedience to him, that actually po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øes the Throne we mu≈øt obey the Law of God.</hi> To this I an≈øwered, <q>where is this Law of God,<note place="margin">Po≈øt≈øcript. p. 11.</note> that commands us to obey U≈øurpers? where is it affirm'd in expre≈øs terms, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from thence by evident con≈øequence?</q> He replies, <hi>he hath ≈øhewed it before, and it is in his book ≈øtill and there I may ≈øee it.</hi> As if I had not at all con≈øider'd, what he had ≈øaid in his Book in my An≈øwer. But to ≈øay, that he would examine that pre≈øently would not have been ≈øo ≈øharp, nor half ≈øo magi≈øterial, as to ≈øay <hi>it is in my book ≈øtill, and there he may find it.</hi> But by his favour, I cannot find that he hath ≈øhewed it, either in his former, or in his new book, and that he hath only ≈øaid it, but not ≈øhewed it, will appear pre≈øently. But I had ≈øaid, that <hi>this Law had need be very clear and evident, and the Dr. had need be very ≈øure of it, when he builds not only his Book, but his practice upon it, in plain contradiction (by his own confe≈ø≈øion) to the Laws of the Land:</hi> He replies, <hi>I never confe≈ø≈øed this was contrary to the Laws of the Land; but on the contrary, that the Laws of the Land, if we will believe learned Judges and Lawyers, do allow and ju≈øtifie it.</hi> I don't know what he means by <hi>confe≈ø≈øing,</hi> but if to maintain, that a Per≈øon po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the Throne <hi>contrary to Law</hi> is to be owned and obeyed as King; if to write a Book in ju≈øtification of that Doctrine, and to call that Book his Rea≈øons, be to <hi>confe≈øs</hi> it; then the Dr. hath <hi>confe≈ø≈øed</hi> it to the purpo≈øe. And I don't know how I ≈øhould prove this, except I ≈øhould reprint his <hi>Ca≈øe of Allegiance,</hi> with a new Title, and call it his <hi>Confe≈ø≈øions.</hi> For there is not a page nor an argument but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øes it, bating only ≈øome part of the An≈øwer to this objection: But the objection it ≈øelf, and the fir≈øt an≈øwer as plainly confe≈øs it as words can do. The ground of the objection is, that it is <hi>contrary to the Laws of the Land,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contrary to our duty; and the ≈øub≈øtance of the An≈øwer is, that <hi>what he hath ≈øaid</hi> i. e. what he had ≈øaid before concerning Providence and U≈øurped Powers <hi>is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer to it,</hi> And it is ≈øo, <hi>when the Laws do not contradict the Laws of God:</hi> And yet he <hi>never confe≈ø≈øed</hi> it; and all for this poor ≈øhift, becau≈øe, in an≈øwer to an objection, and a ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond an≈øwer too, Foreign to his whole Book; he had ≈øaid, that according to the opinion of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107829:51"/> Learned Judges and Lawyers, the Laws do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; now the Que≈øtion is, whether his <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothe≈øis</hi> or his Arguments to prove it, proceed upon any ≈øuch allowance, or have any manner of re≈øpect to it. And I wonder what the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion of providence as he handles it, has to do with his opinion of <hi>Judges and Lawyers,</hi> or the <hi>Laws</hi> them≈øelves; for he debates the matter in direct oppo≈øition and contradiction to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws. And to ≈øay he never confe≈ø≈øed what is the ≈øubject matter, the whole ≈øcope and drift of his Book; becau≈øe <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> and what does not in the lea≈øt relate to his <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothe≈øis</hi> he had mention'd the Judges and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers for the Laws, is a mean Eva≈øion; and (if the Dr. likes his own words better) <hi>a childi≈øh piece of Sophi≈øtry, and argues great contempt of his Readers.</hi>

            <p>The Dr. tells us, (as to the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this Law commanding obedience to U≈øurpers) <hi>That the Scripture is plain in the Ca≈øe, and that he is pretty ≈øure of it: But</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>he proves the Scripture cannot be clear in the point,</hi> my Words are [that it is not clear is evident not only] <hi>from the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øies about it, in the late di≈ømal times of <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpation, that</hi> (≈øaith the Dr.) <hi>is to ≈øay, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be clear in Scripture which is matter of controver≈øie, and thus we mu≈øt either be Scepticks in Religion, or ≈øeek for an infallible interpreter. Thus Hereticks oppo≈øe the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith: Thus Papi≈øts di≈øpute again≈øt the Scriptures being a Rule of Faith. And whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the≈øe arguments will carry our Author, I cannot tell, but they look very kindly towards</hi> Rome; <hi>and if that be his inclination, I can pardon his</hi> zeal <hi>in this Cau≈øe;</hi> what, and is Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> come to take up with the≈øe ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and ≈øcandalous arts to hunt his Adver≈øaries by a cry of Popery? I perceive the ≈øame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples will always have the ≈øame practices. This is indeed very ≈øpightful, but it is withal very ridiculous; the Dr. does not deny, but tho he was not <hi>factious,</hi> yet he <hi>was hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and</hi> zealous <hi>again≈øt taking the Oaths;</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 79.</note> and had he at that time any kind <hi>inclinations</hi> towards <hi>Rome?</hi> But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice is fooli≈øh, and that is an≈øwer enough to ≈øuch <hi>charitable inuendo's:</hi> Well? <hi>But thus Papi≈øts di≈øpute again≈øt the Scriptures being a Rule of Faith.</hi> And what if they do? and therefore whoever di≈øputes thus again≈øt the Scriptures, not being clear in a particular Text, <hi>looks very kindly towards</hi> Rome: An admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble con≈øequence! As if there was no difference between concluding, that the Scriptures are not clear from the controver≈øies about them; and therefore are not a Rule of Faith, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from a particular controver≈øie, that the Scriptures are not clear in a particular point. And I hope a man may think a particular Text ob≈øcure, and may collect it from the di≈øputes of learned men about it, without any great fear of running into <hi>Sceptici≈øm</hi> or <hi>infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> But be that as it will, it is not the Ca≈øe here, and the Dr. does not fairly repre≈øent my words or meaning: For I never ≈øaid, <hi>The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures cannot be clear in the point,</hi> for I think they are clear enough to any unprejudiced man. But all that I ≈øaid was, <hi>That it is not clear that there is ≈øuch a Law of God,</hi> That is, it is not clear, that the Drs. ≈øen≈øe is the ≈øen≈øe of Scripture, and I hope there is ≈øome difference between ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture is not clear, and ≈øaying his ≈øen≈øe of it is not clear: So that (if the Dr. plea≈øe) the Que≈øtion is not whether the Scripture be <hi>clear</hi> in the point, but whether the ≈øen≈øe he hath given of it be <hi>clear.</hi> And that it is not I ≈øaid, <hi>is evident not only from the controver≈øies about it in the late times of <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpation,</hi> but, &amp;c. which the Dr. thus expounds, <hi>That is to ≈øay, nothing can be clear in Scripture, which is matter of controver≈øie;</hi> that is to ≈øay, the Dr. expounds away my meaning, and then di≈øputes again≈øt his own expo≈øition, for I believe that the contrary to what the Dr. a≈ø≈øerts is clear in Scripture; tho Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> and Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> have <hi>controverted</hi> it, and I think it is not the le≈øs <hi>clear</hi> for any thing they both have ≈øaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. But I think likewi≈øe, that the ≈øen≈øe ≈øome men give of Scripture, and particularly the ≈øen≈øe the ≈øaid two Drs. have given of the 13 to the <hi>Romans,</hi> &amp;c. is not clear; and that it is not ≈øo, may be <hi>evident from the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øies about it,</hi> which I did not expre≈øs ≈øo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, much le≈øs with an univer≈øal negative as the Dr. expounds it, but with limitation to a particular time and occa≈øion, in the <hi>late times of <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpation;</hi> for tho it cannot be ≈øaid that <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is clear which is matter of controver≈øie;</hi> yet it may be ≈øaid that ≈øomething is <hi>not clear</hi> which is matter of controver≈øie, and it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107829:52"/> not to be clear, not merely from its being controverted, but from that joyn'd with ≈øome other circum≈øtances, as is the Ca≈øe; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øie about it <hi>in the late times,</hi> may be an evidence that it is not clear, tho the bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øie about it may not.</p>
            <p>And let any man con≈øider the ≈øtate of this Controver≈øie in tho≈øe times, and the Parties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it, and he may ea≈øily be ≈øatisfied. Now the Drs. <hi>Hypothe≈øis</hi> and Arguments were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed by tho≈øe Advocates for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpation,</hi> with all art and skill, and as much to advantage as the Dr. him≈øelf hath done: (And if the Dr. doubts of this, I will upon his reque≈øt make it good by enumeration of particulars,) and it mu≈øt be confe≈ø≈øed, that that was a fit ≈øea≈øon to examine into this Doctrine; and the members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> were at that time as judicious and learned for their intellectuals, and as pious and ≈øincere for their morals as any age hath bred. And that which gives a lu≈øtre to their virtues, and recommends to the World, not only their memories and practices, but their Doctrines al≈øo (as far as a meer humane exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can recommend them) is that (after the example of their glorious Sovereign) they were all <hi>Confe≈ø≈øors,</hi> and ≈øome of them <hi>Martyrs</hi> for the Doctrine of the Church, and the Laws of the Land. And the≈øe were the men that held the other ≈øide of the Que≈øtion: And of this very ca≈øe it is that the Dr. ≈øpeaks ≈øo contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and ≈øcornfully: <hi>That is to ≈øay nothing can be clear in Scripture which is matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øie,</hi> as if there was no difference between a bare controver≈øie, and a controver≈øie in the≈øe circum≈øtances; for this I plainly refer to, and it is next to impo≈ø≈øible that the Dr. ≈øhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand me otherwi≈øe; for what can I po≈ø≈øibly mean by the controver≈øies about this Doctrine in the <hi>late times?</hi> but what was manag'd by the <hi>Regicides,</hi> and their Abettors, on the one ≈øide, and if the Dr. plea≈øe on his ≈øide of the Que≈øtion; and on the other by the Loyal and Excellent members of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And I wonder what he means by being <hi>clear,</hi> is that clear which appears, or is pretended to appear only to men of vitious and corrupt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and for corrupt ends (I ≈øpeak here of the late times) and does not appear, nor can be ≈øeen, by men of the greate≈øt integrity and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities? And this is plainly the Ca≈øe, and let the Dr. if he can ≈øhew me any one Per≈øon (when this controver≈øie was at the heighth) who own'd his Hypothe≈øis, who was not likewi≈øe very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in his Principles relating to Government, or on the other hand, any one Per≈øon, who was of true Principles, and of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that embraced this Doctrine or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition, or who did not (as far as appears) perfectly and in expre≈øs terms di≈øown and abhor it. And this I think if the bya≈øs be not very great, may ea≈øily ≈øatisfie any man, that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øies in the late times</hi> about this Doctrin, are a ≈øufficient evidence that ≈øuch a ≈øen≈øe as the Dr. contends for, is not very <hi>clear,</hi> except a man is re≈øolved to call that <hi>clear</hi> which no body can ≈øee but him≈øelf. And this plainly ≈øhews the incon≈øequence of his Inferences. <hi>Thus</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>Hereticks oppo≈øe the Articles of Faith;</hi> Yes ju≈øt thus, that is, they produce all the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox</hi> plainly and clearly determining on their ≈øide; <hi>Thus Papi≈øts di≈øpute again≈øt the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures being a Rule of Faith:</hi> That is by ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when that controver≈øie was in debate, that all and every one of the <hi>Prote≈øtants</hi> gave their judgments, that the Scripture was no Rule of Faith.</p>
            <p>I added to ≈øhew the Drs. ≈øen≈øe was not clear: That <hi>no learned men could ever e≈øpy this Law before the times of</hi> John Goodwin. To this he replies, <hi>what does he think of Mr.</hi> Calvin <hi>and</hi> Grotius, <hi>who have both pa≈ø≈øed for learned men? And they e≈øpyed this Law before</hi> John Goodwin. Now I expected the Dr. would have produced <hi>one</hi> at lea≈øt of the Church of <hi>England</hi> on his ≈øide; but ≈øuch a one it ≈øeems was not to be found, and therefore he gives us two Forreigners, both learned men indeed, but again≈øt one there is ju≈øt exception, and the other is not for him. Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> for any thing I know may be of the Drs. opinion; and any man that con≈øiders the turbulent State of <hi>Geneva</hi> at that time, and the Revolution there, will be able to give a Rea≈øon for it, and I think there is no great Que≈øtion, but as he ≈øuited his Church Di≈øcipline, ≈øo he did his Doctrines about Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to the circum≈øtances of that State. And his Doctrine of a power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved to inferior Magi≈øtrates,<note place="margin">

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:107829:52"/> to ≈øay no more, the Judgment of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in point of Government hath always been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded by the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and it is a great evidence the Dr. is very much ≈øtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for Authors when no body but Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> can be found to concur with him. He might if he had pleas'd have nam'd Dr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and it would have done as well.

               <hi>But</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>What ≈øen≈øe does this make of what the Prophet</hi> Daniel <hi>≈øays, that</hi> God chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Times and Sea≈øons, removeth Kings and ≈øetteth up Kings. <hi>By Kings here, according to our Author, the Prophet means, not U≈øurpers but rightful and lawful Kings. And then the meaning is, that God pulleth down rightful Kings, and ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth up rightful Kings. Now as for ≈øetting up rightful Kings, our Author likes it very well, but how does be like pulling down rightful Kings, which is as much again≈øt Law and Right, as to ≈øet up Kings without Right? and that it ≈øeems he does.</hi> Very well, and ≈øo he does; and does this contradict any thing that I have a≈ø≈øerted?

He tells me, <hi>He doubts not, but our Author would be a≈øham'd to ≈øay this.</hi> And he is in the right: I ≈øhould be a≈øham'd to ≈øay that, and a great many other things too: but it ≈øeems he is not <hi>a≈øham'd</hi> to charge that upon my Hypothe≈øis, which is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contradiction to it. My Hypothe≈øis, as he repeats it, and di≈øputes again≈øt it, is, that <hi>an <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper is no King;</hi> and therefore the Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a King, cannot, according to that <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the≈øis,</hi> ≈øignifie the Removing an U≈øurper, but of a Rightful King, <hi>i. e.</hi> a true King, not a pretended one: but then I think it follows, that the ≈øetting up of Kings, mu≈øt ≈øignifie the ≈øetting up of true Kings likewi≈øe, and not U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurpers, who are not Kings. And this I do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt upon (and it is not a ≈øtrife about words) and let the Dr. prove if he can, that an <hi>

And here is the plain ≈øtate of the Ca≈øe, The Scripture a≈ø≈øerts (and if the Scripture had been ≈øilent, the Doctrine of Providence ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evidences) that <hi>God removes Kings, and ≈øets up Kings.</hi> And this proves, that what Kings are remov'd, they are remov'd by God, and what Kings are ≈øet up, they are ≈øet up by God: But this does not prove that tho≈øe are Kings, which are not Kings, or that <hi>

Do we u≈øe to ≈øay, a man may give his E≈øtate to whom he will, when his E≈øtate is entail'd, and he cannot alienate it from the Right Heir? we ≈øhould think this a very ab≈øurd way of ≈øpeaking among men? and yet thus our Author mu≈øt expound God's giving a Kingdom to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever he will, to ≈øignifie his giving the Kingdom to the Right Heir.</hi> Now here are as many <hi>Sophi≈øms,</hi> as there are lines: and fir≈øt of all, I do readily acknowledge, that <hi>whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever</hi> does not ≈øignifie tho≈øe only who have a Legal Right; but the fallacy is evident: for God gives all the World, as well as Crowns, to <hi>whom≈øoever</hi> he will. But for all that, no body
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107829:56"/> hath a right to private E≈øtates but by the Laws of the Land. And it would be a fine Plea, in <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter-Hall,</hi> to argue upon God's Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Providence; Another man hath a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Title, but God gives the World to <hi>whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever he will;</hi> and tho he hath no Legal Title, what then? Does <hi>whom≈øoever,</hi> ≈øignifie tho≈øe only who have a Legal Title? Thus likewi≈øe <hi>giving,</hi> in the notion of it, does not ≈øuppo≈øe an antecedent Right, but with re≈øpect to God's giving, and a Right by Humane Laws it does: for God gives Property to them, who have ≈øuch a Right; and he does not give it them who have no ≈øuch Right, tho they may po≈ø≈øe≈øs it by fraud and inju≈øtice. But here the fallacy lys in dividing what ought not to be divided: for what is given by ju≈øt Laws, God gives; and the antecedent Right is the Gift of God; and what God gives by Laws, which he hath made a Rule, is not to be defeated by Providence, which he hath not made a Rule. He asks again, <hi>Does</hi> giving to whom≈øoever he will, <hi>≈øignifie giving it only to tho≈øe to whom the Law gives it?</hi> I an≈øwer no; it does not ≈øignifie ≈øo; neither does it ≈øignifie <hi>Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion only.</hi> But this I can tell him, it ≈øignifies every jot as much ≈øo in Kingdoms and Governments, as it does in private Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions and E≈øtates. And the Propo≈øition in Scripture is as univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øal, that God gives every thing, all the Profits, Honors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the World, to <hi>whom≈øoever he will:</hi> or if it was not in Scripture, it is a Doctrine plain enough; and every man that owns Providence mu≈øt own it. And it is a pure con≈øequence, that every man who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øtly po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of an E≈øtate, hath a Divine Right to it, tho not a Legal one; becau≈øe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øooth <hi>giving it to whom≈øoever he will, does not ≈øignifie, giving it only to tho≈øe to whom the Law gives it.</hi> It is in vain here for the Dr. to an≈øwer as he does often in his <hi>Vindication,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 58.</note> That tho≈øe <hi>matters are refer'd to the Redre≈øs of publick Laws; but the≈øe God re≈øerves to his own cognizance and di≈øpo≈øal.</hi> For the Que≈øtion here, is about the importance and ≈øignification of the≈øe Expre≈ø≈øions. And here his Que≈øtions turn upon him; Does <hi>whom≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi> ≈øignifie tho≈øe only, who are redre≈øs'd by <hi>Publick Laws?</hi> Does <hi>giving</hi> ≈øignifie only a Sentence of a Judg, or the Verdict of a Jury? Does <hi>giving to whom≈øoever he will, ≈øignifie giving it only to tho≈øe, to whom the Law gives it?</hi> And if they do ≈øignifie ≈øo, then his Que≈øtions are vain; if they do not, then his Argument is vain, and there is nothing to be concluded from the≈øe Expre≈ø≈øions for the Drs. purpo≈øe: for they are equally affirm'd in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and equally true of private E≈øtates, as of Governments. The Expre≈ø≈øion is the ≈øame, and the Latitude is the ≈øame in both Ca≈øes: He that gives Crowns, and that gives E≈øtates to <hi>whom≈øoever he will,</hi> equally gives them to <hi>whom≈øoever he will.</hi> And what difference ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is between Thrones and private E≈øtates, between matters above Humane Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals, and ≈øuch as are ≈øubject to them, there is none at all in <hi>giving them to whom≈øoever he will.</hi> And if it be a good Argument for Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion again≈øt Legal Right, that <hi>God gives to whom≈øoever he will,</hi> then 'tis likewi≈øe a good Argument in all ca≈øes: for God gives to <hi>whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever</hi> he will in one ca≈øe, as well as the other. And <hi>whom≈øoever</hi> and <hi>giving;</hi> and <hi>giving to whom≈øoever God will,</hi> ≈øignifie the very ≈øame in both ca≈øes; <hi>whom≈øoever</hi> no more <hi>≈øignifies tho≈øe who have a Legal Right,</hi> nor <hi>giving, an antecedent Right in him to whom it is given,</hi> nor <hi>giving to whom≈øoever he will, giving it only to tho≈øe to whom the Law gives it,</hi> with re≈øpect to private E≈øtates, than it does to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments. And if it cannot be concluded from ≈øuch a <hi>≈øignification,</hi> that a wrongful po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion again≈øt Law, is God's gift, and ought to be own'd as ≈øuch, the Drs. Argument from ≈øuch a <hi>≈øignification,</hi> is trifling and falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. And that is the only thing in que≈øtion. And the truth is, ≈øuch kind of Arguments prove nothing. For the Propo≈øition in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that God gives Kingdoms, and that he gives Riches and private E≈øtates to <hi>whom≈øoever he will,</hi> is deny'd by no body that believes a God and Providence. And that is not the Que≈øtion; but the Que≈øtion is, whether a Providential Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion again≈øt Legal Right, be a ≈øuffient Evidence of <hi>That Will?</hi> And that it cannot be concluded from tho≈øe general Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions, nor from the Doctrine of Providence, is plain enough from the in≈øtance before: and this ≈øhews, how un≈øuitable the Ca≈øe is which
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107829:56"/> he brings for a Parallel, <hi>Do we u≈øe to ≈øay a man may give his E≈øtate to whom he will, when his E≈øtate is entay'ld, and he cannot alienate it from the Right Heir?</hi> I ≈øay no: We do not u≈øe to ≈øay ≈øo, becau≈øe it is none of <hi>his</hi> to give. But this we <hi>u≈øe to ≈øay,</hi> that if any man has an E≈øtate of his own to give, he mu≈øt <hi>evidently</hi> give it, before the Per≈øon to whom he gives it, can have a good Title to it: And if he that claims by ≈øuch Gift, has no other Evidence but Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, I doubt that will be no bar to the <hi>Heir at Law.</hi> And it would be a Ridiculous Plea for ≈øuch a Po≈ø≈øe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øor, to ≈øay that he that own'd the E≈øtate, might give it to <hi>whom≈øoever</hi> he would. And <hi>whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever</hi> did not <hi>≈øignifie</hi> the Heir at Law; nor did <hi>giving to whom≈øoever he would,</hi> ≈øignifie giving it only to tho≈øe, to whom the Law gives it.

            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>it is more ab≈øurd ≈øtill, if we apply it to the occa≈øion,</hi> viz. <hi>tho≈øe great Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and Changes of Empires, which the</hi> Prophet <hi>foretold, and which he attributes to God:</hi> And where is this great ab≈øurdity? Why ≈øaith he, <hi>when Kingdoms and Empires are overturned by violence, it is</hi> non-≈øen≈øe <hi>to talk of God's ≈øetting up only Rightful Kings, not <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpers.</hi> Yes, by all means; To ≈øay that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was a <hi>Rightful</hi> King, is <hi>non-≈øen≈øe.</hi> And to ≈øay that the <hi>Romans</hi> were <hi>Rightful</hi> Governors, is <hi>non-≈øen≈øe;</hi> and the Convocation ≈øpeak <hi>non-≈øen≈øe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Convoc. p. 82.</note> when they expre≈øly affirm it. To ≈øay that forceable and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Beginnings, may afterwards acquire a Right, is <hi>non-≈øen≈øe.</hi> The≈øe it ≈øeems are ≈øuch things which no body can under≈øtand, and they plainly contradict the Rea≈øon of Mankind. Now I grant, that <hi>non-≈øen≈øe</hi> is an <hi>ab≈øurdity;</hi> but I think 'tis <hi>ab≈øurd</hi> likewi≈øe, to charge any Propo≈øition with <hi>non-≈øen≈øe,</hi> and not be able to make it out. <hi>But</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>Kingdoms are not transferred, nor Kings remov'd, nor ≈øet up by Law: And therefore when the</hi> Prophet <hi>tells us with re≈øpect to ≈øuch violent Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that God changes times and ≈øea≈øons, that he removeth and ≈øetteth up Kings, an ingenious man mu≈øt be hard put to it to ≈øay, this is not meant of <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpers, but of Rightful and Legal Kings.</hi> And why ≈øo I pray? Is it ≈øo very hard to conceive, how vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Revolutions, may end in a Legal Right, and become Ju≈øt Governments? Or is there any nece≈ø≈øity from the violence of the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, to conclude, that a Prince ≈øetled in the Throne upon ≈øuch a Revolution, could not have acquir'd ≈øuch a Right? This is plainly fal≈øe in fact: The Revolution in <hi>Judaea</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> was as violent as any, and yet he had acquir'd a Right to the Government of it, by the Submi≈ø≈øion of the Legal Prince, as well as by God's expre≈øs Will: And this is the fir≈øt in≈øtance that the≈øe words of <hi>Daniel</hi> refer to; and the ≈øame is to be ≈øaid of all the re≈øt of the Governments within the Compa≈øs of that Prophetical Interpretation. And therefore the <hi>violence</hi> of the Revolution, is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Unrightfulne≈øs of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And tho the Prophet tells us, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect to ≈øuch violent Revolutions, that God removes and ≈øets up Kings, it can never from thence be concluded, that by ≈øetting up Kings, is meant U≈øurpers; becau≈øe in the very Ca≈øe to which the words refer, tho≈øe Kings were not U≈øurpers: And becau≈øe the nature of the thing does not imply it: for a Revolution may be violent, and yet the Government ≈øetled upon it, be Legal and Rightful, and not U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. And this I take to be the ≈øtate of the Ca≈øe: Revolutions are not made by Laws, but thorough Settlements are: and it is not a Revolution, but a thorough Settlement, that di≈øtingui≈øhes between an U≈øurper, and a Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King; or if the Dr. plea≈øe, between a King and no King. He that in a violent Revolution, as violently po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øes him≈øelf of the Throne, and hath no more Right to it after, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is an U≈øurper, and no King; but he that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:107829:57"/> afterwards acquires a Right, is a King, and no U≈øurper. The Dr. differs as to the notion of a Settlement; but the inference, even with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect to his own notion, is the ≈øame: for he owns, that it is not a duty to obey a Per≈øon in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne, 'till he is tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly ≈øetled (in his ≈øen≈øe). And that is, till then, he is no King; for he is a King of Clouts, whom no body is bound to obey; ≈øo that either way it is not <hi>God's ≈øetting up,</hi> or <hi>≈øetting upon the Throne,</hi> that denominates a King, but that joyn'd with other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances, and the Que≈øtion between us is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is the Con≈øent of the States and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or the Acqui≈øition of Right.</p>
            <p>The Dr. ≈øays, <hi>If I will allow the di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed Kings to be Legal Kings, he wonders how I ≈øhould fan≈øie, that tho≈øe Kings who di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øs the Rightful Kings, and place them≈øelves in their Thrones, ≈øhould in my ≈øen≈øe be Legal and Rightful Kings too.</hi> And yet I had told him how, as plain as I could ≈øpeak, by the Death or Ce≈ø≈øion of tho≈øe di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed Kings. And the Dr. if he plea≈øe, may wonder ≈øtill; but it had been as well, if he had an≈øwer'd it.</p>
            <p>I now come to his Te≈øtimony from the New Te≈øtament, Rom. 13.1, 2. <hi>Let every Soul be ≈øubject to the Higher Powers;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 52.</note> 
               <hi>for all power is of God,</hi> &amp;c. To this I ≈øaid, that <hi>by Powers, the Dr. under≈øtands <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurped as well as Lawful Powers.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Po≈øt≈øcr. p. 12.</note> 
               <hi>And his Rea≈øon is, becau≈øe the Scripture makes no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinction between Kings and <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpers.</hi> And to the≈øe, the Dr. adds tho≈øe words he had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in his <hi>Ca≈øe of Allegiance (between Kings whom we mu≈øt, and whom we mu≈øt not obey):</hi> And then tells me, <hi>the≈øe la≈øt words I conceal, becau≈øe they ≈øpoil all my Argument.</hi> And if they do ≈øo, I will confe≈øs it was ill done to conceal them: But if they do not, 'tis humor≈øome and captious to complain of it. And let us ≈øee his Rea≈øon; <hi>For</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>he adds, I thought the Ca≈øe of</hi> Athaliah <hi>had been a Di≈øtinction, and had this precept been given in tho≈øe days, I wonder whether any body would have doubted of whom it ought to be under≈øtood, of</hi> Athaliah, <hi>or</hi> Joa≈øh. Very well, this was my Argument; but how comes this to be ≈øpoyl'd by tho≈øe la≈øt words? That I cannot tell; and it may be, the Dr. will tell me in his next. But at pre≈øent he replys, <hi>There was a di≈øtinction between</hi> Athaliah <hi>and</hi> Joa≈øh, <hi>that ≈øhe was an <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper, and he a Rightful King:</hi> and the Dr. makes a <hi>Di≈øtinction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper, and a Rightful King, with re≈øpect to their <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpation and their Right: But</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>this I ≈øay, the Scripture makes no di≈øtinction between a Rightful King and an <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper, with re≈øpect to the obedience of Subjects, while they are ≈øetled in the Throne.</hi> No! What does he think of ≈øetting up <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> when out of po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion; and depo≈øing <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> when in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion? This I think is a di≈øtinction between a Rightful King and an U≈øurper, <hi>with re≈øpect to the obedience of Subjects.</hi> And, with the Drs. leave, I am apt to believe, that Killing on the one hand, and Crowning and Allegiance on the other hand, is a con≈øiderable <hi>di≈øtinction</hi> in that re≈øpect. What follows that <hi>in reference to this, the Ca≈øe of</hi> Athaliah <hi>is no Example of ≈øuch a di≈øtinction, becau≈øe the</hi> Jews <hi>might and did lawfully ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to her, and that ≈øhe was afterwards depos'd, was owing to the Divine Entail.</hi> This hath been urged, and an≈øwered before, and it is not at all to the Drs. purpo≈øe now. For the Que≈øtion here is <hi>only,</hi> whether there be ≈øuch a <hi>di≈øtinction</hi> in Scripture, with re≈øpect to the Subject's Obedience. And if the ≈øetting up <hi>Joa≈øh,</hi> and the depo≈øing and ≈ølaying <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> be not a <hi>Di≈øtinction,</hi> there is no ≈øuch thing as a <hi>Di≈øtinction</hi> in the World. The Dr. adds, <hi>Had this Law been given to the</hi> Jews <hi>at that time, while</hi> Joa≈øh <hi>was conceal'd, it mu≈øt have been expounded of</hi> Athaliah, <hi>who had po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne, when</hi> Joa≈øh <hi>was known and anointed, it mu≈øt have been expounded of him, as having a Divine Right to the Throne of</hi> Judah. That is to ≈øay, this Law would have been expounded of the U≈øurper, if there be no Right Heir, or none known; but when the Right Heir is known, it is to be interpreted of him, and not of the U≈øurper. As if any body could think this Law would have been expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of <hi>Joa≈øh,</hi> if he had not been living, or had not been thought to have been living. But what I pray has this <hi>Concealment</hi> to do in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? The <hi>Di≈øtinction</hi> is not between the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment</hi> of the one, and the <hi>Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion</hi> of the other, but between <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpation,</hi> and both vi≈øible: between <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> out of Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:107829:57"/> and <hi>Athaliah</hi> in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne. And here is the Que≈øtion, <hi>of whom ought this Precept to be under≈øtood, of</hi> Athaliah <hi>or</hi> Joa≈øh? if of <hi>Athaliah,</hi> then ≈øhe was ordain'd of God, and to re≈øi≈øt her, had been to receive Damnation, which was plainly fal≈øe; for ≈øhe was re≈øi≈øted and killed, and both ju≈øtify'd: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, if it was to be under≈øtood of <hi>her,</hi> then it could not be under≈øtood of <hi>Joa≈øh;</hi> for it cannot be interpreted of Two Competitors. But if it mu≈øt be under≈øtood of <hi>Joa≈øh,</hi> then a Rightful Prince out of Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, is the <hi>Higher Powers</hi> in the ≈øen≈øe of this Text, and an U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, is not. And then the whole Rea≈øon of the Drs. Argument fails, then the <hi>Powers that be,</hi> may be the <hi>Rightful Powers</hi> out of Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, in the intention, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the direction of that Text. And then there is a <hi>Di≈øtinction in Scripture between Kings whom we mu≈øt obey,</hi> and U≈øurpers (the Dr. calls them <hi>Kings) whom we mu≈øt not obey;</hi> which is the thing to be proved.</p>
            <p>I proceeded, <hi>But (≈øaith the Dr.) if the Apo≈øtle had intended ≈øuch a Di≈øtinction, he ought to have ≈øaid it in expre≈øs words, and why ≈øo I pray?</hi> The Dr. replys, <hi>I gave him a rea≈øon for it, which he is plea≈øed to conceal, why ≈øhould we think the Apo≈øtle here intends a di≈øtinction unknown in Scripture?</hi> But ≈øure I did not conceal this, for I had ≈øpoken to it ju≈øt before, as much as I thought needful; and I did not ≈øee any rea≈øon to repeat it again. The Dr. adds, he ≈øaid, <hi>had there been any ≈øuch Rule before given to ≈øubmit to lawful Powers, but not to ≈øubmit to <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpers, there had been ≈øome pretence of under≈øtanding St.</hi> Paul's <hi>all power, of all Legal Power; but there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing like this any where el≈øe in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? If he had intended any ≈øuch di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he ought to have ≈øaid it in expre≈øs words, or el≈øe no body could rea≈øonably have under≈øtood him to intend this Precept of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the higher powers, only of Powers that had a Legal Right.</hi> Now I cannot tell why the Dr. ≈øhould ≈øay I conceal'd this, for I an≈øwer'd it, and that I think is not concealing it. I had ≈øaid <hi>are there not general</hi> Rules <hi>about right and wrong, which extend to all Ca≈øes and Per≈øons?</hi> And if they extend to <hi>all Ca≈øes and Per≈øons,</hi> then there are Rules in Scripture about the Right and Wrong of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and about Legal and U≈øurped Powers, and ≈øo I meant it, and could mean nothing: and ≈øo that if the Dr. had any Rea≈øon to di≈øprove this he had no Rea≈øon to ≈øay,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 53.</note> 
               <hi>This I thought a very good Rea≈øon, and did not expect to have been asked for more, till they had been an≈øwer'd:</hi> for that is a very good an≈øwer to it, as we ≈øhall ≈øee pre≈øently.</p>
            <p>He goes on, <hi>But (≈øaith our Author) does not the nature of the thing ≈øufficiently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtingui≈øh it?</hi> He replyes, <hi>the nature of the thing di≈øtingui≈øhes between a Legal King, and an <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper; but the nature of the thing does not prove, that u≈øurped powers are not the higher powers, and ought not to be obey'd, but I think proves the quite contrary:</hi> that is to ≈øay, the nature of the thing di≈øtingui≈øhes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween who has, and who has not a Right to the Government. And that I think is ≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to di≈øtingui≈øh between who are, and who are not <hi>the Higher Powers.</hi> And it had been ≈øuperfluous to di≈øtingui≈øh in expre≈øs terms, what is imply'd in the very Precept; as the Precept to obey Parents, Husbands, Ma≈øters, do not expre≈øly di≈øtingui≈øh between tho≈øe which are, and tho≈øe which are not ≈øo; for 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways imply'd, and an expre≈øs di≈øtinction is needle≈øs. And there is no Rule in Scripture given, to ≈øubmit to lawful, and not unlawful Husbands, and Ma≈øters, any more than there is to ≈øubmit to lawful and not unlawful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors. But I think for all that, no body que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtions of whom the Precept is intended; or that tho≈øe that are the lawful, are tho≈øe only that are meant, altho there be no expre≈øs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinction excluding the unlawful from any ≈øhare or partner≈øhip in it. But the truth is, that is always imply'd, and ≈øuch ca≈øes are under the direction of general Rules: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ≈øaid, <hi>Are there not general Rules about Right and Wrong,</hi>

               <hi>which extend to all Per≈øons and Ca≈øes?</hi> By which I meant, that the Rights and Wrongs that re≈øpect Government, are under the direction of tho≈øe Rules, as much as the Rights and Wrongs that concern Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Property.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107829:58"/> him, and become party's to his inju≈øtice, nor to ≈øupport and abet it again≈øt Right, by virtue of the≈øe general Rules, as they are the ≈øame in private Ca≈øes He that abets an unju≈øt Po≈ø≈øe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øor of the Throne, is as much <hi>Particeps cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis</hi> as he that abets an unju≈øt Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor of any other mans e≈øtate. And now let us hear his reply, <hi>Yes</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>there are</hi> (≈øuch gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules) <hi>≈øuch is the Apo≈øtle's Rule in this Chapter,</hi> to give to every one their due: <hi>But then the Que≈øtion returns what is their due?</hi> Before I con≈øider his An≈øwer, I ≈øhall crave leave to give him this An≈øwer to his Que≈øtion, Po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne is their <hi>due.</hi> And this I think can never be deny'd by a man that owns the di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed Prince hath ≈øtill a <hi>Legal Right, by virtue of which he may recover his Throne if he can;</hi> and if he hath a Right to it, then it is <hi>due</hi> to him: And I would fain know how engaging, and endeavouring all we can, and ≈øwearing to keep him from his Right, be a compliance with this Precept <hi>to give to every man his due.</hi> The Dr. hath a ≈øubtle Di≈øtinction between a Right to the Government, and a Right to Allegiance, which I ≈øhall con≈øider pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently, but if it was granted him, it will not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the force of this Argument; for ≈øuppo≈øe the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor of the Throne had a Right to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, and the di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed Prince a Right to the Government; how comes Allegiance to warrant an Act of inju≈øtice, to pray and fight, and do all we can, again≈øt a manife≈øt Right, and which we know to be ≈øo. If he ought to have the Government,<note place="margin">Ca≈øe of Alleg. p.</note> as the Dr. expre≈ø≈øes it, <hi>he ought to be King but is not,</hi> then 'tis inju≈øtice to keep him from it; for no man <hi>ought</hi> to have what can <hi>ju≈øtly</hi> be kept from him. And then I would fain know by what Rules of Con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Allegiance (if it were due) can ju≈øtifie our acting again≈øt a moral Law. For if obedience be not his Right, the Crown is, and obedience to the mo≈øt Rightful Prince in the World will not excu≈øe our aiding and a≈ø≈øi≈øting him, in the unrighteous taking or keeping another man's E≈øtate, if it be notorious and manife≈øt.</p>
            <p>We come now to the Drs. An≈øwer to this Que≈øtion, <hi>What is their due? whether Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and Obedience be not due to the Prince, who governs, not to the Prince who does not, and cannot govern, whatever his Legal Right to the Government be?</hi> And to this he ≈øays, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the controver≈øie turns on it he ≈øhall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly con≈øider it.</hi> The Arguments he ≈øays is this, <hi>He who by the Laws of the Land has a Right to the Crown, has a Right to our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance; and whether he be in or out of Po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øion to own any other King, and to ≈øubmit and pay Allegiance to any other, though actually po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of, and ≈øetled in the Throne, is a great inju≈øtice to our natural Prince, and a violation of that precept to give to every one their due.</hi> To this the Dr. An≈øwers, <hi>Here are two things to be con≈øidered,</hi> 1. <hi>The Right to the Crown.</hi> 2. <hi>The Right to Allegiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the fir≈øt the ≈øub≈øtance of his An≈øwer is, <hi>The fundamental prejudice and mi≈øtake, ≈øeems to be, the making no difference between a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Right to the Crown, and a Legal Right of Subjects to their E≈øtates;</hi> but the Dr. <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends a great difference, that in ≈øetling an E≈øtate, nothing more is required but a meer Humane Right, but to make a Legal King, be≈øides an Humane Right to the Crown he mu≈øt have God's Authority: Nothing but a Legal De≈øcent and Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion gives Right to a Legal E≈øtate; and therefore the Law mu≈øt have its effect: And is the only adequate Rule of right and wrong in ≈øuch Ca≈øes; and tho the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God allots mens private fortunes, yet he gives no man a right to an E≈øtate which he gets by fraud, nor exempts them from Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal puni≈øhments, but leaves all ≈øuch meer Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Rights, under the general influence of Providence, to the care of Publick Government. But if a meer Humane Right cannot make a King, but God's Authority makes a King; if God re≈øerves this Authority in his own hands, and does not in≈øeparably annex it to Humane Entails of the Crown, if God's Authority with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Humane Right can make a King, but Humane Laws cannot make a King without God's Authority; this may ≈øatisfie us, that when God thinks fit to interpo≈øe his Authority, a meer Legal Right is not ≈øufficient Rea≈øon to adhere to a Prince God has removed from the Throne; nor the want of a Legal Right, ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient rea≈øon to di≈øown a Prince, whom God has ≈øet upon the Throne.</hi> Now here is ≈øome variety of expre≈ø≈øion, but very little new matter but what the Dr. had ≈øaid, and what is an≈øwered before; but he hath a peculiar delight in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107829:58"/> his An≈øwers over and over; but I hope I may be excu≈øed if I do not follow him in that. And therefore as to the difference in the Events of providence, with re≈øpect to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and private E≈øtates; and as to God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerving his Authority in his own hands, and his interpo≈øing by providence: I ≈øhall refer the Reader to the An≈øwers I gave before to them; at pre≈øent this An≈øwer is ≈øufficient: That the Law, and not Providence, is the adequate Rule of right and wrong with re≈øpect to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, as well as with re≈øpect to the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øors of private E≈øtates, and the Law ought to have its effect in one ca≈øe, as well as the other; and I would feign know how providence comes to be a <hi>Rule of right and wrong</hi> in any ca≈øe, or what ≈øen≈øe the Dr. can make of ≈øuch a propo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? 'tis mere trifling and fallacious to ≈øay, that <hi>to make a Legal King, be≈øides a Humane Right to the Crown, he mu≈øt have God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> And what then? therefore he that has Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion and no Legal Right has God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? This is a wild con≈øequence; He that is Ma≈øter of the <hi>Temple</hi> hath a Legal Right to it, but be≈øides that Right he mu≈øt have God's Authority to preach and admini≈øter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and therefore who≈øoever by Intru≈øion and U≈øurpation Preaches and Admini≈øters the Sacraments there, is Ma≈øter of the <hi>Temple.</hi> The Dr. knows well enough, that we have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øie with him about God's Authority; but about the Communication of it, whether this Authority be communicated by the <hi>Events</hi> of providence (the methods and intentions of which are un≈øearchable) or by fixed and ≈øtated Rules, allowed and commanded by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to be ob≈øerved; or whether the Subject in whom this Authority re≈øides, be him that has a Legal Right to the Government, or him that has no Right; ≈øo that it is not at all to his purpo≈øe to prove, that a Legal King mu≈øt have God's Authority, or that God's Authority makes Kings; for no body doubts of that, but the Que≈øtion is, whether the Authority of God be annexed to the Legal Right, or to the Events of providence. He ≈øays, <hi>God does not in≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably annex his Authority to Humane Entails.</hi> Right, but then he does annex it, tho not in≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably, and no body can ≈øeparate it but him≈øelf, and the Que≈øtion is, whether a meer eventual Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion be ≈øuch a ≈øeparation; God does not in≈øeparably annex property to Legal Right, but may di≈øpo≈øe of it by his own Sovereign Will and Council; He gave the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> goods to the <hi>I≈øraelites,</hi> as well as <hi>Joram</hi>'s Crown to <hi>Jehu.</hi> And therefore the <hi>fundamental mi≈øtake</hi> the Dr. ≈øpeaks of, of <hi>making no difference between a Legal Right to the Crown, and a Legal Right of Subjects to their E≈øtates</hi> is no mi≈øtake at all; for there is no difference with re≈øpect to God's Sovereign Will, no difference with re≈øpect to providence, which is the main Que≈øtion. Well, <hi>but for ≈øetling an E≈øtate, nothing more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired but a meer Humane Right: But to make a Legal King, be≈øides an Humane Right to the Crown, he mu≈øt have God's Authority; by ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling an E≈øtate,</hi> the Dr. means a <hi>Right</hi> to it; otherwi≈øe it is not to the purpo≈øe, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a difference between <hi>Legal Right</hi> to the Crown, and a <hi>Legal Right</hi> to private E≈øtates; as he ≈øays afterwards, <hi>nothing but a Legal de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and a Legal Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion gives Right to a Legal E≈øtate.</hi> And this is his own mi≈øtake, for God is Proprietor of all the World; and all the World is his as well as Authority, and no man can have a Right to any part of it, but as that Right is derived to him from God, <hi>meer Humane Right,</hi> or meer Humane Law, gives no more Right to a private E≈øtate, then it does to Authority; for all is Gods, and it is not the peculiar Ca≈øe of Authority, but every thing el≈øe pa≈ø≈øes by delegation and commi≈ø≈øion from him; no man hath a Right to his E≈øtate or Goods, and no man hath a Right to Authority but what God gives. But the only Que≈øtion is, how the≈øe Rights are conveyed; and that is by the re≈øpective Laws of each Country, he that hath a Right by Law, hath a Right from God, and he that hath not a Right by Law hath no Right from God: The Laws as authorized and appointed by him, are the Channels whereby this Right is conveyed; and he that po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øes him≈øelf any other way, makes a property to him≈øelf, but he hath no Right to it, and God does not give it him: This therefore is not (as the Dr. talks) confining God, but ob≈øerving the Rules and Methods he him≈øelf hath war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted and directed. There are indeed ≈øome Ca≈øes, wherein the Law makes a Property, and God does not; but this is quite contrary to the Drs. Hypothe≈øis and confutes it: And that is, when by fraud and inju≈øtice and corrupt means,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107829:59"/> men gain E≈øtates; they may have a Title in Law to their unju≈øt acqui≈øitions, but they hold them by U≈øurpation, and have no Right to them with re≈øpect to God, and are bound to re≈øtore them, which is a Demon≈øtration they have no Right to them, nor hath God given them, tho he permits them by his providence to po≈ø≈øe≈øs them≈øelves of them. And this plain and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Doctrine, ≈øits hard upon more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples than one of the Drs. And from thence it plainly followe, he that attains any thing by unju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t and wicked arts, hath no Right to it in re≈øpect of God, what≈øoever he may ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have in re≈øpect of Men; and if he that unju≈øtly gains a ≈øhilling is ≈øo far an U≈øurper, and hath for that rea≈øon no Right to it from God, then he that by as bad or wor≈øe arts U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurps a Throne, has likewi≈øe no Right to it in re≈øpect of God: And this directly contradicts the fundamental Doctrine of the Drs. Books.</p>
            <p>But perhaps the Dr. may like this better in his own words, and he may find them in his <hi>Di≈øcour≈øe of Religious A≈ø≈øemb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ies</hi> (p. 85.) <hi>There is a va≈øt difference between God's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the pro≈øperity of bad men, and that con≈øtant providence which watches over good men; bad men may advance them≈øelves by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øtice, oppre≈ø≈øion, and perjury, but they are not advanced by the ble≈ø≈øing, but by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion of God, for God never ble≈ø≈øes any wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed arts; and therefore ≈øuch mens pro≈øperity is very uncertain, and as tottering as the <hi>Thrones of V≈øurpers;</hi> for tho they have a good Title with re≈øpect to men, yet they are but <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpers, with re≈øpect to God, and therefore are tumbled down at his plea≈øure.</hi> Now this I take to be very good Doctrine, and the Dr. hath not formally renounc'd it, but he hath inverted the Argument, and ≈øet it with the <hi>heels</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and <hi>Now</hi> tho≈øe that by the mo≈øt wicked and unju≈øt arts are U≈øurpers with re≈øpect to men, have a Divine Right and a good Title with re≈øpect to God, which is ≈øuch a way of God's giving Right, and men receiving a Right from him, that no Ca≈øui≈øt in the World ever dreamed of before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As for the Right to Allegiance,</hi> The Dr. tells us, <hi>it was the great de≈øign of his book to prove, that Allegiance was not immediatly due to a Legal Right to the Crown, but to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that therefore he denies a Prince who has the Legal Right, no Right which he can ju≈øtly claim, who denies Alleg. to him, when he is out of the Throne. And</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>methinks our Author ≈øhould have an≈øwered all that I ≈øaid upon this Argument, before he had ≈øo d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now I have proved over and over, that Allegiance is due on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Legal Prince; that it is not due to an U≈øurper, who actually admini≈øters the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but to the Legal Prince when he does not actually admini≈øter it. And that I think is an≈øwering it; but ≈øome men complain for want of an≈øwers, when they have more already then they can tell what to do with. But the Dr. is ≈øure <hi>the Rea≈øon of things does not prove the contrary: For when the Allegiance and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Subjects, is a duty only for the ≈øake of Government, for the ea≈øe and ≈øafety of it, it is very ≈øtrange, that it ≈øhould not be due to a ≈øetled Government, but due to a Prince, who does not, and cannot govern;</hi> cannot govern? who hinders him? why, as the Dr. puts the Ca≈øe, the U≈øurper and his Confederates; and that is an argument that they owe him no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance; ju≈øt as <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his accomplices fir≈øt di≈øabled the King, and then cryed they ow'd him no Allegiance, becau≈øe he could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them. <hi>But Allegiance is for the ≈øake of Government, and therefore whoever actually governs (let him be who he will) hath a Right to Allegiance;</hi> but fir≈øt, arguments drawn from the <hi>≈øake</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of things to prove the tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of Rights and Duties are ab≈øurd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con≈øequent; Marriage is for the <hi>≈øake</hi> of Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Society; and if a Husband is impri≈øoned or under force, ≈øo as he cannot keep his Wife company; it is <hi>very ≈øtrange,</hi> that ≈øhe ≈øhould
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107829:59"/> not be a Wife to him that does keep her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and not to him, who neither does nor can; and ju≈øt ≈øuch another argument, is the Drs. from the <hi>≈øake</hi> of Government: But the Truth is Allegiance, is not due to <hi>Government,</hi> nor is it for the ≈øake of Government, but it is due and owing to the Per≈øon of the Prince, by the Laws of God and Man; and therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows his Per≈øon, whether in or out of Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion. But let us put the Argument into the terms of the Que≈øtion, and in≈øtead of <hi>Government</hi> put <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpation,</hi> and then ≈øee what the <hi>Rea≈øon</hi> of things prove, and then I think it is plain enough, that <hi>the Allegiance and Obedience of Subjects, is not a duty</hi> only or at all <hi>for the ≈øake of <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,</hi> nor were they ever intended <hi>for the ea≈øe and ≈øafety</hi> of U≈øurpation, but the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, what is a duty for <hi>the ≈øake and ≈øafety</hi> of the Legal Government, is for the prevention and de≈øtruction of U≈øurpation: And it is ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what extraordinary to ≈øay that was for the <hi>≈øake</hi> of U≈øurpation, which was de≈øigned to prevent it.</p>
            <p>The Dr. proceeds, <hi>if I may have liberty to di≈øpute with this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor upon his own Principles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 56.</note> 
               <hi>I de≈øire to know of him, whether Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance be due to any Prince upon any other account, than his being inve≈øted with God's Authority? Let him ≈øay it at the utmo≈øt peril of his Cau≈øe.</hi> Now I confe≈øs I am not very fond of giving up my Cau≈øe <hi>gratis,</hi> except the Dr. could give me ≈øome better rea≈øons for it; yet becau≈øe the Dr. threatens, and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates,<note place="margin">P. 65.</note> that I am no very <hi>cool</hi> man, and ≈øo may be apt to be provoked; this I will ≈øay, and let him make his be≈øt of it; That Allegiance is due to the Prince upon the account or by the obligation of Humane Law: Now this is either <hi>another account</hi> or the very ≈øame; if <hi>another account,</hi> then the Drs huffing Que≈øtion means nothing, and there is no peril in ≈øaying ≈øo, if the very ≈øame, then Humane Law in this Ca≈øe is God's Authority, and God's Authority is derived by Humane Law, and then his Arguments mean nothing. And this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwers his following Que≈øtions, <hi>How then does God inve≈øt any Prince with his Authority of Government, whom he does not immediatly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate as in the Kingdom of</hi> Judah? why tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ju≈øt as he inve≈øts a man with a property to any of his Goods or E≈øtate, even by Law and Common Right. But ≈øaith he, <hi>it mu≈øt be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by annexing his Authority to the Legal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or by placing ≈øuch a Per≈øon on the Throne by what means ≈øoever he does it, or by both.</hi> I do not know what the Dr. means by <hi>Both;</hi> the controver≈øie is, when there is a competition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Legal Right</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpation,</hi> and then the Que≈øtion is, which of the≈øe are inve≈øted with God's Authority? And then I ≈øay, that God annexes his Authority to the Per≈øon, who hath a Right to the Government, and not to the U≈øurper who hath no Right. And this is an an≈øwer according to my Principles which the Dr. pretends to di≈øpute upon. But if the Dr. had rather have it in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>s own expre≈ø≈øions, then I ≈øay, that God does annex his Authority to the <hi>Legal Office.</hi> And he, who≈øe the Legal Office is, has God's Authority, whether he be or be not actually po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of that Office; the Office is his who hath a Right to it, and the Authority is his from God, and no body el≈øe hath either the Authority or the Office, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudes upon both, and invades God's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as much as he does another mans Office. But ≈øaith he, <hi>then it is certain, no Prince can have God's Authority, who is not in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne, and then no Allegiance can be due to him.</hi> Now this con≈øequence lies a great way of, and at fir≈øt ≈øight a man would be apt to admire how it ≈øhould follow from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øes, for tho it might do pretty well from one of the branches, from <hi>placing a Per≈øon on the Throne by what means ≈øoever;</hi> yet how comes it to follow from the other, from <hi>God's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing his Authority to the Legal Office.</hi> The Propo≈øitions are complex and made up of ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts, and the conclu≈øion is drawn from one of them; for how does it follow, becau≈øe God hath annexed his Authority to the Legal Office; therefore no Prince hath his Authority who is not in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne? is there any more an in≈øeparable connexion between the Legal Office of a King, and Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne, than there is between a Legal E≈øtate, and an Illegal Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of it? A Legal E≈øtate is the right owners, whether he be po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øed of it or no, and a Legal Office is his who hath a Right to it, and all the Authorities, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, and Preeminencies that are annexed to it are his, whether he actually has the office in Po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øion
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107829:60"/> or not. Property is annexed to Right and not to Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion; and who≈øoever hath a Right to any thing that thing is his, and no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies el≈øe, and who≈øoever hath a Right to an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the Office is his, and the exerci≈øe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtration of it, does not alter the Property; Well, but the Dr proves it, <hi>If,</hi> ≈øays he, <hi>God's Authority be annexed to the Regal Office, a Prince mu≈øt be in the actual admini≈øtration of the Regal Office and Power, before he can have God's Authority.</hi> Now this is nothing but the old ≈øtory of <hi>Actual Admini≈øtration</hi> over again, only it was before applied to <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and here it is apply'd to the <hi>Regal Office.</hi> But the Argument and An≈øwer is the ≈øame; the Regal Office is his who hath a Right to it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of it or no; <hi>And if God's Authority be annexed to the Regal Office,</hi> it is annexed to his Per≈øon who≈øe the Office of Right is, and not to his, who≈øe it is not; every thing is the right owner's, whether it be in his own Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, or injuriou≈øly kept from him.

               <hi>But</hi> (≈øays he) <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>gives a general charge to be Subject to the higher Powers and generally affirms, that all Power is of God; and therefore, if he had not intended that we ≈øhould under≈øtand this, as univer≈øally as he expre≈ø≈øes it,</hi> of all powers <hi>however they came by their Power, he ≈øhould have limited it to Legal and Rightful Powers:</hi> Very well! and I pray is not the charge to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> as <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> as that to the <hi>Romans?</hi> it is not ≈øaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed obey <hi>all</hi> them that have rule over you; but it is expre≈ø≈øed indefinitely (which is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollent to an univer≈øal) and in con≈øtruction it is to be under≈øtood univer≈øally, and means the ≈øame, as if it had been expre≈øly ≈øaid <hi>All</hi> them that Rule.

God doth not govern mankind like Bea≈øts in a De≈øert, where every thing is Prey and Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, but by the Rules of Society, which confine and determine Property, and fix the bounds of it: And it would be a wi≈øe Que≈øtion to ask, How does God make a man a Right Po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øor of an E≈øtate in <hi>England?</hi> He does it by his Providence, but it is according to Laws: How did God make Kings in <hi>Judah,</hi> after he had entayl'd the Crown? why he made them by his Providence, but it was according to that entail; and ≈øo in other Kingdoms God makes Kings, and private Proprietors by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but it is according to the ≈øtandards of Right and Ju≈øtice, that are fix'd and ≈øetled among men, and authoriz'd and confirm'd by God him≈øelf, and by the expre≈øs declarations of his will: And what≈øoever exceeds, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the≈øe, is Inva≈øion and Wrong, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and Rapine, expre≈øly di≈øallow'd, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid by God him≈øelf. And to ≈øay God gives by his Providence, what he forbids by his Revealed Will, is an Impious Doctrine, and ju≈øtifies my charge again≈øt the Drs. interpretation, that it makes Providence a Rule of Practice, again≈øt Right and Ju≈øtice. And a man may as well ≈øay, that God gave to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, tho he forbid them upon pain of Death, to eat of it, becau≈øe all Events are by Providence; and they were permitted by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to take it.</p>

               <note place="margin">P. 59.</note> 
               <hi>who places ≈øuch a Prince on the Throne, if God don't? Our Author according to his Principles mu≈øt an≈øwer, that by God's permi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion he u≈øurps the Throne, but is no King, much le≈øs a King of God's making; well, let him call him what he plea≈øe, it ≈øeems a Prince may a≈øcend the Throne, and govern a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for many years, without God's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and then I de≈øire to know, whether God rules in ≈øuch a Kingdom, while an <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper fills the Throne:</hi> I ≈øay yes, God does govern by his Providence, but not by communicating his Authority to the U≈øurper. And what does the Dr. think of tho≈øe times of U≈øurpation in this Kingdom between 48 and 60? Did God govern in the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> all tho≈øe 12 years or not? And therefore what he ≈øays, <hi>for indeed will any man ≈øay, that God governs ≈øuch a Kingdom, as is not govern'd by his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Mini≈øter?</hi> is perfect fallacy by his own Principles; for he him≈øelf ≈øays it: and I ask him, had the <hi>Rump</hi> or <hi>Cromwell</hi> God's <hi>Authority</hi> or not? If they had, then four or five Leaves of his Book, and his account of their not being ≈øettled, and all that he ≈øays on that Head, is meer trifle, and contradicts what he ≈øays here: For if they had God's Authority, they ought to be obey'd, and no pretences of Loyalty could excu≈øe it. But if not, then God may govern a Kingdom, when tho≈øe per≈øons, who actually govern <hi>for many years,</hi> have not his Authority; nor yet are his Mini≈øters (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe than as the Devil and wicked men are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters to execute the de≈øigns of his Providence, but not as deriving any Authority from him: or thereby claiming any Right by vertue of their Actual or Providential Government.) And thus his following Que≈øtion is an≈øwer'd, <hi>Does Providence and Government ≈øignifie only his permi≈ø≈øion? that God looks on, and ≈øees men ≈ønatch at Crowns, and take them
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107829:63"/> and keep them, and exerci≈øe an Authority, which he who is univer≈øal Lord of the world never gave them?</hi> Now here is a large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈øs, and if the Drs. Argument ≈øignified any thing, it would prove, that all the Sinful Events that ever were, or ≈øhall be in the world, have God's Authority re≈øpectively annex'd to them: for if it does follow, that becau≈øe <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Government do not ≈øignifie permi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion,</hi> that becau≈øe <hi>God does not meerly look on the affairs of the world, therefore whatever Authorities and Powers men</hi> ≈ønatch, <hi>and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe, and keep, God who is the univer≈øal Lord of the World, gives them.</hi> Then it plainly follows, that whatever Powers men have, and whatever Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions or Goods they <hi>≈ønatch or keep,</hi> tho never ≈øo unju≈øtly, they are all the Gifts of God, and there is a Right and Property in them deriv'd from the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øal Lord of the World. But to our In≈øtance And then the <hi>Rump</hi> and <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and the <hi>High Court of Ju≈øtice,</hi> exercis'd God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and <hi>Charles</hi> the Fir≈øt was murder'd, and his Son rob'd of his Crown by God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: For <hi>Providence and Government</hi> ≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the ≈øame in tho≈øe days as they do now. And I wonder what the <hi>peoples con≈øent ≈øignifies</hi> according to this Doctrine? <hi>Does Providence and Government ≈øignifie permi≈ø≈øion,</hi> when the people do not con≈øent, but not when they do? <hi>Does God look on, and ≈øee men ≈ønatch at Crowns, and take them, and keep them, and exerci≈øe an Authority, which he never gave them,</hi> when there is no con≈øent in <hi>Parliament,</hi> but otherwi≈øe when there is? One of the≈øe, the Dr. mu≈øt for≈øake, and I believe he had better ≈øtick to the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Regicides</hi> and <hi>Cromwell,</hi> for then his Principles will be con≈øi≈øtent, and all of a piece, whereas now they agree like fire and water, and perpetually cla≈øh and contradict each other.</p>
            <p>Here the Dr. ≈øtarts an Objection, <hi>that to ≈øay that pro≈øperous <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpers are placed in the Throne by God, and have his Authority, is to make God a party to their wickedne≈øs.</hi> And thus he an≈øwers, <hi>This is another Argument, not meerly again≈øt God's making Kings, but in general again≈øt God's Providence and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: for if God cannot direct and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule rule the wickedne≈øs of men to accompli≈øh his own wi≈øe Coun≈øels and Purpo≈øes, without being the</hi> Author <hi>of tho≈øe ≈øins, whereby ≈øuch events are brought to pa≈øs, there is an end of the Providence of God, or of his Holine≈øs or Ju≈øtice.</hi> And then he takes abundance of pains to prove, that <hi>God can over-rule the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of Princes, and the faction and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Subjects; that if he can permit the wickedne≈øs of men, without being guilty of their ≈øins, To direct and over-rule their wickedne≈øs to wi≈øe purpo≈øes, can be no blemi≈øh to Providence:</hi> And who denys this? But what is all this to the purpo≈øe? Is there no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>over-ruling</hi> wickedne≈øs, and giving Authority to it? Is it the ≈øame thing to <hi>over-rule the Ambition of Princes, and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Subjects to wi≈øe ends,</hi> and to Crown them with the Highe≈øt Priviledges and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, to ≈øtamp a Divine Character on them, and to command all men to Obedience and Reverence. God can, and does over-rule the wickedne≈øs of men, to accompli≈øh the wi≈øe and ju≈øt de≈øigns of his Providence; but is that any argument, that a wicked po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, is a Divine Right, and a Patent from Heaven, when a man is ≈øpoyl'd of his Goods or E≈øtate, by the mo≈øt wicked and unju≈øt means, God may over-rule that wickedne≈øs, to cha≈øti≈øe and correct the Right Owner for his Sins, or to cure his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and Carnal Affections, or to improve his Patience and Vertues. But does this create a Right and Property in the Cheat or Robber? In the Pre≈øent Ca≈øe, God may over-rule the wickedne≈øs of U≈øurpation, to cha≈øti≈øe the Sins of a Prince or People, or to try the con≈øtancy and fidelity of men to their Principles, or for other wi≈øe ends; But is this a proof, that an U≈øurper is <hi>Jure Divino?</hi> To <hi>over-rule</hi> wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edne≈øs, and to transfer a Right to it, are two very different things. The Dr. in≈øtances in the Crucifixion of our <hi>Saviour, which was the mo≈øt glorious de≈øign of God's Providence, and was accompli≈øh'd by very wicked means,</hi> and which were over-ruled by God, to ≈øerve that glorious end; but that did not give any <hi>Authority</hi> to <hi>Judas</hi> to betray him, nor yet convey any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right to the Thirty Pieces, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd as the Reward of his Treachery.</p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:107829:64"/>
            <p>And therefore the Dr. hath not put the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection right with reference to the di≈øpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us; and it ought to have been this, <hi>That to entitle a wicked <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpation to God's Authority, and a Divine Right, is to make God a Party to their wickedne≈øs.</hi> And then I would fain ≈øee, how this comes to be <hi>an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument again≈øt God's Providence in general?</hi> For what tho <hi>God can</hi> and does <hi>direct and over-rule the wickedne≈øs of men to accompli≈øh his own wi≈øe coun≈øels and purpo≈øes, without being the Author of tho≈øe ≈øins whereby ≈øuch events are brought to pa≈øs?</hi> How I pray does this deny any thing of God's <hi>directing</hi> and <hi>over-ruling</hi> wickedne≈øs? Is it all one to <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>over-rule</hi> wickedne≈øs to wi≈øe Coun≈øels and purpo≈øes, and to <hi>give authority</hi> to it? To give authority to wickedne≈øs, is to own and authorize it, to put upon it his own <hi>image and ≈øuper≈øcription:</hi> And to a≈øcribe this to God, is to make him a <hi>party</hi> to it, if it be po≈ø≈øible to know what that word means. And therefore what follows is quite be≈øide the purpo≈øe: The Dr. ≈øuppo≈øes <hi>no man will deny, but God may give the Kingdoms of the World to whom he plea≈øe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 60.</note> 
               <hi>and pull down one Prince, and ≈øet up another without inju≈øtice;</hi> and then tells us, <hi>the only di≈øpute can be about God's bringing ≈øuch events to pa≈øs by the wickedne≈øs of men, and what hurt is there in this, if God can ≈øo over-rule the ambition of Princes, or the faction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of Subjects, as to do that in pur≈øuit of their own lu≈øts which God for wi≈øe and holy rea≈øons, thinks ≈øit to have done.</hi> Why truly I know no <hi>hurt</hi> in all this; only it is not at all to the purpo≈øe, till the Dr. will plea≈øe to ≈øhew us, how <hi>over-ruling</hi> comes to ≈øignifie <hi>giving Authority.</hi> He ≈øuppo≈øes again, <hi>an Ambitious Prince, which God may permit to ravage, and depopulate, and ≈øubdue King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;</hi> and then asks, <hi>Which mo≈øt becomes the Divine Wi≈ødom to ≈øuffer ≈øuch men, when they plea≈øe to overturn Kingdoms, and to bring horrible de≈øolations on the World, only to gratifie their own lu≈øts, or to give the Reins, and pro≈øperous ≈øucce≈øs to them, when he ≈øees fit, to new model the World,</hi> &amp;c. and then adds, <hi>I am ≈øure, this much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Wi≈ødom and Ju≈øtice of Providence, than a bare permi≈ø≈øion of ≈øuch violence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any farther de≈øign, which does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the wi≈øe Governor of the World.</hi> Not to meddle with tho≈øe bold expre≈ø≈øions, what does, or what does not <hi>become the wi≈øe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the World,</hi> I am ≈øure, it <hi>becomes</hi> us to ≈øpeak a little more mode≈øtly. And ≈øuppo≈øe God hath ≈øome farther de≈øign, in permitting ≈øuch Violences and De≈øolations, than barely permitting them, does it follow therefore, that he gives his <hi>Authority</hi> to tho≈øe Violences and De≈øolations? The Drs. Inference is, <hi>And if God may permit ≈øuch wickedne≈øs and violence, without being a Party to their wickedne≈øs, much more may he over-rule their wickedne≈øs for wi≈øe ends, and make them Executioners of his Ju≈øtice, in puni≈øhing a wicked Age, and transferring Kingdoms,</hi> that is to ≈øay, As God by permitting the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of men, is not a party to their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs; ≈øo neither is he by over-ruling it. Right! But where is the Con≈øequence, and therefore the entitling U≈øurpation to his Authority, is not making him a Party to their wickedne≈øs; he adds indeed, <hi>And then why may not God give them tho≈øe Kingdoms he hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by them?</hi> This is the only Point, and it is dwindled into a Que≈øtion: And the very Que≈øtion de≈øtroys all that is ≈øaid before. God may give them tho≈øe Kingdoms if he plea≈øe: But then if he does, this is not <hi>over-ruling</hi> wickedne≈øs, but conferring a ju≈øt Title; and God indeed is not a Party to their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, becau≈øe they are Righteous Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øors. But then we are never the nearer to ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: The Que≈øtion ≈øtill returns, Is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in oppo≈øition to common Right, ≈øuch a Gift? So that all this while, we are but where we were. The Dr. gives a Rea≈øon, <hi>For I ≈øuppo≈øe it is as agreeable to the Sovereignty, Wi≈ødom and Ju≈øtice of God, to give a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to a Violent <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper, as to ≈øuffer a Wicked, Impious and Tyrannical Prince to a≈øcend the Throne with a Legal Title, which,</hi> ≈øays he, <hi>God often does.</hi> Now here are two things to be ob≈øerv'd.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God may give a Kingdom to an U≈øurper, if he plea≈øe, as well as he did to <hi>Jehu;</hi> but
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107829:64"/> then when he hath given it him, ≈øuch Gift extingui≈øhes his U≈øurpation, and he ju≈øtly and hone≈øtly po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øes it; and whatever wickedne≈øs he might be guilty of before, it is none to wear that Crown which God gives him. So that indeed in ≈øuch a Ca≈øe God is not a Party to their wickedne≈øs; but the Rea≈øon is not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe <hi>God permits wickedne≈øs with a farther de≈øign,</hi> or becau≈øe he <hi>over-rules it, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli≈øh his own wi≈øe ends;</hi> but becau≈øe it is not Wickedne≈øs and Inju≈øtice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What the Dr. brings for a Parallel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes him. <hi>God may permit an Impious and Tyrannical Prince to a≈øcend the Throne,</hi> and he may likewi≈øe permit him to <hi>ravage</hi> and <hi>depopulate,</hi> with a <hi>farther de≈øign to over-rule them to accompli≈øh his own holy and ju≈øt purpo≈øes.</hi> But then this does not give God's Authority, to his <hi>Impious</hi> and <hi>Tyrannical Acts.</hi> And I would fain ≈øee a good rea≈øon, why God's having a <hi>farther de≈øign in permitting wickedne≈øs,</hi> and <hi>over-ruling</hi> it, gives his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpation,</hi> any more than it does to <hi>Tyranny?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the truth is, the Drs. account here furni≈øheth us with admirable mea≈øures of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice and Righteou≈øne≈øs; and let us tran≈ølate this Doctrine to other matters of Providence be≈øides Government, and ≈øee then how it looks; and this we may do by the Drs. allowance: for he tells us, it is <hi>an argument not only again≈øt God's making Kings, but again≈øt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in general.</hi> And therefore <hi>I ≈øuppo≈øe, no man will deny, but God may give the <hi>goods of this world</hi> to whom he plea≈øe, he may <hi>take them from one, and give them to another</hi> without inju≈øtice, the only di≈øpute can be about God's bringing this to pa≈øs by the wickedne≈øs of men; and what hurt is there in this, if God can over-rule the <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> and <hi>rapine</hi> of men, as to do that in pur≈øuit of their own lu≈øts, which God for wi≈øe and holy rea≈øons thinks fit to have done: ≈øuppo≈øe a <hi>wicked and cunning man,</hi> ≈øpurr'd on by <hi>covetou≈øne≈øs,</hi> whom God may permit by <hi>fraud and violence to wrong and oppre≈øs all his neighbors,</hi> I ask any man, which mo≈øt becomes the Divine Wi≈ødom, to ≈øuffer ≈øuch men, when they plea≈øe, to <hi>≈øpoil their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,</hi> only to gratifie their own lu≈øts, or to give them ≈øucce≈øs when he ≈øees fit to cha≈øtize and puni≈øh <hi>≈øuch per≈øons in their goods or e≈øtates.</hi> I am ≈øure this much more becomes the Wi≈ødom and Ju≈øtice of Providence, than a bare permi≈ø≈øion of ≈øuch violence, without any farther de≈øign. And if God may permit ≈øuch wickedne≈øs, without being a party to it, much more may he over-rule it for wi≈øe ends, and make them the Executioners of his Ju≈øtice, in puni≈øhing <hi>wicked people.</hi> And then why may not God give them tho≈øe <hi>Goods or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtates,</hi> which he hath <hi>taken away</hi> by them? For I ≈øuppo≈øe, it is as agreeable to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, Wi≈ødom and Ju≈øtice of God, to give <hi>≈øuch Goods or E≈øtates</hi> to a violent <hi>Robber or Oppre≈ø≈øor,</hi> as to ≈øuffer a <hi>Legal Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to riot and revel, to ≈øpend them upon his Lu≈øts and Vices, or to make them</hi> In≈øtruments of Injury and Inju≈øtice?</hi> And is not this pure Doctrine, and admirably ≈øuited for the advancement of Righteou≈øne≈øs? And it is notwith≈øtanding the true ≈øtate of the Drs. Arguments here; for ≈øuch rea≈øonings extend equally to all Ca≈øes of Providence, to the Ca≈øe of private property, as well as to that of Crowns and Scepters: And the whole Scheme is as applicable to one Ca≈øe as well as the other. The Dr. tells me upon another occa≈øion,<note place="margin">P. 51.</note> which I here return him, <hi>he may if he plea≈øe, call this</hi> giving account of Providence, <hi>but I doubt every body el≈øe will give it ≈øome other name; and I hope he him≈øelf, upon ≈øecond thoughts, will be a≈øham'd of it.</hi>

               <hi>It is indeed</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>an impious Doctrine to ju≈øtifie every action, and every cau≈øe which has ≈øucce≈øs; God many times pro≈øpers very

That 'tis nece≈ø≈øary, and a duty, to take an Oath contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to that, to another Per≈øon; all this is purely to be determin'd by Providence, without any manner of other Right or Title, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a plain and known Rule, acknowledg'd by the Dr. him≈øelf, and by all the world. And if this be not to make <hi>external ≈øucce≈øs the mea≈øure of Good and Evil,</hi> and <hi>to conclude, that to be God's Cau≈øe, which is pro≈øper'd by Providence,</hi> I wi≈øh the Dr. would tell me, what is. And if he plea≈øe likewi≈øe to favour me with the Solution of this Que≈øtion, Whether U≈øurpation be God's Cau≈øe? if it be, whether the Dr. hath any other proof of it, be≈øides ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ≈øucce≈øs, and the Providence of God pro≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering it? if it be not God's Cau≈øe, what can ju≈øtifie our ≈øwearing to abett, ≈øupport and maintain it? So that either the Dr. mu≈øt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this <hi>Impious Doctrine,</hi> that God's Cau≈øe is to be mea≈øured by <hi>Succe≈øs</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> or another as <hi>impious,</hi> that we are bound in Con≈øcience, to do the utmo≈øt to maintain that which is not <hi>God's Cau≈øe.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>But,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>yet it is ≈øo far from being an impious Doctrine; that it is a nece≈ø≈øary duty, to conform our ≈øelves to the Divine Providence, and to di≈øcharge tho≈øe duties and obligations, which the Providence of God lays on us, according to the nature and intention of the Providence:</hi> Now if by the <hi>nature and intention of Providence,</hi> the Dr. means, that God by ≈øuch a <hi>Providence,</hi> intends to lay ≈øuch duties on us, it is true enough, and we are bound to conform our ≈øelves to the Divine Providence, and to di≈øcharge tho≈øe duties: as when God by his Providence puts us into a ≈øtate of affliction, it is our duty to conform our ≈øelves to his will, and to perform the Duties that Providence points out to us by that di≈øpen≈øation, to be patient, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant, and faithful, to be ≈øure to keep a good Con≈øcience, and not be affrighted from our duty, nor di≈øcourag'd in the practice of it. The≈øe are duties that are con≈øequent upon ≈øuch a ≈øtate, and which the Divine Providence directs us to, and the nature and intention of the Providence, is plain and evident. But this is not at all to his purpo≈øe. But if by <hi>the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and intention of Providence,</hi> the Dr. means, that what things come to pa≈øs in the world by Providence, it is our duty, and the intention of Providence, that we ≈øhould comply actively with them, own them, and adhere to them. <hi>This is manife≈øtly fal≈øe in a thou≈øand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances,</hi> and particularly in all Robberies, U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, and Inva≈øions of other mens Rights. The Que≈øtion therefore is not, Whether we are to conform our ≈øelves to Providence, and to di≈øcharge duties according to the nature and intention of Providence; but whether it be the intention of Providence, that we are to e≈øpou≈øe, and embrace, and pur≈øue the intere≈øt of U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, and all other Events that are manife≈øtly unju≈øt and unrighteous. The Que≈øtion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øtill returns, What are the Duties and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, that the Providence of God lays on us, and what are the Intentions of Providence? Does God when he permits wicked and unju≈øt U≈øurpations, and other Villanies, require us to fall down and reverence, to joyn our ≈øelves to them, and to plead the Cau≈øe of Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs? This is to interpret Gods Providence in contradiction to his Laws: But what is all this to Providence being a Rule, which the Dr. ≈øaid he would con≈øider, how far it might be? He adds, <hi>Thus the Providence of God, in ≈øome ≈øen≈øe may be the Rule of our Practice, and may make that our duty which was not; and that cea≈øe to be our duty, which was ≈øo before. And thus it always is, when the Providence of God changes our Relations, or condition of life, as in the pre≈øent ca≈øe, when he removes one King, and ≈øets up another; for he mu≈øt transfer my Allegiance, when he changes my King:</hi> that is to ≈øay, when a Woman is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, ≈øhe is obliged to the duties of a Wife;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107829:65"/> when her Husband is dead, Providence hath ≈øet her free, and ≈øhe owes her dead Husband no duty: So, when God removes a King, the duty of Subjects cea≈øe; and when they have another Lawful King, they owe him Allegiance. Very true. But the Que≈øtion returns, When is a King remov'd? Is di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, making him no King, and di≈øcharging the Subjects Duty? or is po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, making the U≈øurper a King, and obliging the Subjects? or is that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of providence? The Providence of God, changes Relations; but di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion and di≈øtance, is no change of Relation. A Woman is not free by every providential removal of her Husband from her, but by ≈øuch a Providence only, as puts an end to his Life or Right: nor are Subjects free by every providential removal of their King, but by ≈øuch a Providence only, as puts an end to his Right and Title: And on the contrary, if a man ≈øets him≈øelf in the place of a Husband, the hand of Providence is not to be own'd, nor is he to be ≈øubmitted to as a Husband of Divine Right: A providential Hu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is no Husband, but an Adulterer; and a providential King is no King, but an U≈øurper. And as to Providence being a Rule in any ca≈øe,<note place="margin">Vind. p 44.</note> the Dr. hath urged the≈øe very things before, which I have already an≈øwer'd, and ≈øhall not need to repeat.</p>
            <p>And here the Dr. falls a <hi>Rallying</hi> for almo≈øt two Pages together, <hi>This unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable and impious Doctrine of Providence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vind. p. 62.</note> 
               <hi>is the fault of my Ca≈øe of Allegiance: for ≈øome men cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to hear, God makes Kings; for that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, there is a God.</hi> A fine way of calling his Adver≈øaries <hi>Athei≈øts.</hi> And ≈øo on he goes in the Rallying ≈øtrain, <hi>had he ≈øaid any thing el≈øe, he might have e≈øcaped as well as his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; but ≈øince he hath entitled God to the matter, this ≈øpoils all, and is an impious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: And if that be his fault, he is content to ≈øuffer obloquy and reproach, for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øuch impious Doctrines.</hi> Now if the Dr. can <hi>rally</hi> off the Ab≈øurdity and Impiety of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine about Providence, much good may it do him; I ≈øhall leave ≈øuch arguments to take their chance.

I know Thieves and Robbers have not God's Authority, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath an U≈øurper: but have they not God's Providence, as well as an U≈øurper? And if Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of <hi>Authority</hi> by Providence, gives a Right to it, Why does not the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of <hi>my Pur≈øe</hi> by the ≈øame Providence, give a Right to it?

But the Scripture (≈øaith the Dr.) expre≈øly tells us, <hi>that Kingdoms are di≈øpos'd of by God, that all power is of God;</hi> and does not the ≈øame Scripture tell us, <hi>that the Earth is the Lords, and the fulne≈øs thereof;</hi> that he di≈øpo≈øes of it, as he plea≈øes: that when <hi>Job</hi> was rob'd, he ≈øaid, <hi>the Lord hath taken away.</hi> But if the Scripture had not ≈øaid ≈øo, the Dr. ≈øays it; for he tells us, all Events are God's Act and Deed; and then it mu≈øt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107829:66"/> that the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of my Pur≈øe by a Thief, is as much God's Decree and Council, as the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne. The Doctor founds all this in <hi>God's Creation: God</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>is the natural Lord of the World,</hi>

                  <hi>becau≈øe he made it, and no Creature hath any Right to govern the World, or any part of it, but as he receives Authority from God:</hi> And is not this the ≈øame, in all other re≈øpects? Are not all mens E≈øtates Gods, as well as Authority? And has any man a Right to his E≈øtate, but what God gives him? And does it thence follow, that whatever any man can get by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, tho it be never ≈øo much again≈øt the Laws and Common Right, it is his own, becau≈øe God is not ty'd to Humane Laws, and hath a Right to the World by Creation, and may give it whom he plea≈øe? And I wonder, what rea≈øon there is, that 'tis a more certain ≈øign to us, that the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of power by providence, gives any more Right to it, th n the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Goods or an E≈øtate gives a Right to them.</q>

And that he does not do ≈øo, is manife≈øt from this very Doctrine <hi>of Pa≈ø≈øive Obedience: For the Doctrine of Non-Re≈øi≈øtance and Pa≈ø≈øive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is founded on an irre≈øi≈øtable Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; con≈øider then what are the Rights of an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øi≈øtable Authority, and what the duties of Pa≈ø≈øive Obedience.</hi> 1. <hi>The Rights of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and irre≈øi≈øtable Authority are, that he cannot forfeit his Crown, that he cannot be judged nor depo≈øed by his Subjects; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when once King, he is always ≈øo 'till death or a voluntary and legal Re≈øignation.</hi> 2. <hi>Non-Re≈øi≈øtance does not merely ≈øignifie not to fight again≈øt the King, but</hi> 1. <hi>That upon no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence we mu≈øt renounce his Right, and</hi> 2. <hi>Mu≈øt never ≈øet his Crown upon anothers head.</hi> 3. <hi>Mu≈øt not transfer our Allegiance to another.</hi> Now the Dr. will not except again≈øt this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine for the ≈øake of its Author, and he may plea≈øe to ob≈øerve, that we are not ≈øo apt to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi> as he is to <hi>forget,</hi> and he may trie if he can ≈øolve the matter by his di≈øtinction between <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Faction.</hi> But if this be the ca≈øe, then the≈øe things nece≈ø≈øarily follow. 1. That <hi>Transferring of Pa≈ø≈øive Obedience</hi> from the Rightful King to the U≈øurper, is a Propo≈øition incon≈øi≈øtent with it ≈øelf, and made up of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, <hi>Pa≈ø≈øive Obedience</hi> ≈øignifies one thing, and <hi>transferring</hi> it the clean contrary. And to talk of <hi>transferring Pa≈ø≈øive Obedience</hi> is ju≈øt as if we ≈øhould ≈øay <hi>fighting Non-Re≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance,</hi> or <hi>Rebellious Allegiance.</hi> 2. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the Doctrine of Pa≈ø≈øive Obedience equally affects his interpretation of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as his interpretation of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> for Pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive Obedience, is as evidently and plainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by the Scriptures, as by the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and for the proof of this, I refer my ≈øelf to Dr. <hi>Sherlocks Ca≈øe of Re≈øi≈øtance.</hi> And if his interpretation of Scripture be irreconcilab e with the Doctrine of Pa≈ø≈øive Obedience, then it

            <p>My next Argument is, <hi>That this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation repreaches the Virtue and Loyalty of tho≈øe admirable men, who ≈øuffered between the years</hi> 42 <hi>and</hi> 60.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>He ≈øhould have con≈øidered whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, as well as whom he commended.</hi> Right! and I did ≈øo, but he tells us, <hi>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches all tho≈øe who in tho≈øe times of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion ≈øubmitted to the <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurped Powers, and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quietly and peaceably under them.</hi> But who told him ≈øo? there is no ≈øuch thing in my <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer</hi> or <hi>Po≈øt≈øcript,</hi> is there no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween living <hi>peaceably and quietly,</hi> and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parties to the U≈øurpation, ≈øiding with it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Legal King, pleading the Cau≈øe of it, and <hi>≈øwearing to be true and faithful to it?</hi> The≈øe la≈øt indeed are <hi>reproached</hi> by the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Loyalty of tho≈øe excellent men, and who can help that? Virtue and Truth is always a <hi>Reproach</hi> to Vice and Error. But perhaps the Dr would have had me ju≈øtified the exclu≈øion of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> and the adherence to the U≈øurpers again≈øt him. And this indeed would not have <hi>reproached them.</hi> But it would have <hi>reproached</hi> much hone≈øter and better men than they; it would have <hi>reproached</hi> all tho≈øe Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and Loyal Sufferers for their King and the Laws. But no matter for them, they are not for the Drs purpo≈øe now; but he is grown on a ≈øudden ≈øo very tender of the U≈øurpers Party, that they mu≈øt ≈øuffer no reproach, and rather than that, the be≈øt men of our Church mu≈øt not be commended for fear it ≈øhould reflect on them. But ≈øaith the Dr. <hi>The King found a great many true Friends and Loyal Per≈øons at his return among tho≈øe men.</hi> I ≈øuppo≈øe by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their taking the <hi>Engagement,</hi> and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Books to keep him out, and u≈øing all their endeavours and intere≈øts for that purpo≈øe. Well, but ≈øuppo≈øe <hi>≈øome of them</hi> were <hi>true friends</hi> to the King; why then they are not to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,</hi> not for their being Parties to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurpation again≈øt him, but becau≈øe they were his <hi>true friends.</hi> i. e. becau≈øe they de≈øerted the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpers;</hi> for they could not be true Friends and Loyal to both. And if I have ≈øaid any thing to reproach them for being the Kings friends,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107829:68"/> and abandoning his Enemies, I am content to ≈øuffer reproach my ≈øelf. But as the Dr. hath worded this, it is not ea≈øie to under≈øtand what he means: He ≈øays they were <hi>true Friends</hi> and <hi>Loyal Per≈øons</hi> upon his return. Does he mean that were <hi>then</hi> ≈øo only, but before his return and in the time of U≈øurpation were virulent and mortal Enemies to him, but ≈øo ≈øoon as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd they became <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Loyal.</hi> Methinks this is no extraordinary character: They were his friends, when he could advance them, but in his extremity and when he had need of them they were his enemies; i. e. they were true friends to them≈øelves and not to him, and ≈øuch a kind of friend≈øhip, if it mu≈øt not be reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, does not ≈øure de≈øerve commendation. The Dr. further tells me, I <hi>reproach all tho≈øe Loyal Per≈øons, who ≈øuffered under tho≈øe <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpations and comply now:</hi> And al≈øo, <hi>all tho≈øe who have now ≈øworn Allegiance.</hi> But how can the Dr. tell that? I meddle with no bodies Principles but his, and the Dr. in the next paragraph tells me, <hi>I ought not only to con≈øider what was done, but upon what Principles they did it;</hi> and I have con≈øidered his Principles, and have ≈øhewn, that they reproach the be≈øt Men of our Church; but that it ≈øeems will not do, and I mu≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider <hi>what was done</hi> al≈øo, and <hi>reproach</hi> all them that did it, tho they act upon other Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and tho I con≈øider no bodies Principles but the Drs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next Advice is, <hi>If our Author will argue from Examples, he ought not only to con≈øider what was done, but upon what Principles they did it, whether they were all of our Authors mind, that it is ab≈øolutely unlawful in any ca≈øe what≈øoever to ≈øubmit to a Prince, who is po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øed of the Throne, while the Legal King, or his true Heir is living, tho di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed.</hi> Now I think there is all the evidence in the World that they were of this mind: This was the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ca≈øe, there was a Per≈øon (the Dr. may call him <hi>Prince</hi> if he plea≈øes and agreeable enough to his Principles) <hi>po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed</hi> of the Throne, and the Legal King and Heir <hi>di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed.</hi> And it is plain in fact they refu≈øed to ≈øubmit to the U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the Throne, and adhered to the Legal King out of the Throne. And if the Dr. can find any other rea≈øon or a≈ø≈øertion of theirs for this practice, be≈øides the <hi>ab≈øolute unlawfulne≈øs</hi> of owning the U≈øurper, he would do well to produce it. He ≈øays, <hi>it is probable ≈øome few might be of his mind.</hi> But why does not he name one ≈øingle man of them that was not of this mind? that he can never do, nor does he in the lea≈øt undertake it. But boldly affirms, <hi>that it can never be proved, and it is very improbable, for it was neither the Doctrine of the Church, nor the Law of the Land.</hi> But that is the matter in di≈øpute, and by what Rules of <hi>Logick</hi> is the grand matter in controver≈øie brought for a proof? The Que≈øtion is whether it be the Doctrine of the Church, or Law of the Land; and the practice of tho≈øe great men is urged again≈øt the Drs. interpretation, and is a proof again≈øt him; and how comes the thing to be proved, to be brought in proof again≈øt that which proves it again≈øt him? But this is u≈øual with him. But ≈øays he, <hi>that it was their general ≈øen≈øe (that it</hi> was ab≈øolutely unlawful to ≈øubmit to the U≈øurper, while the Legal King is living tho out of Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion) <hi>can never be proved.</hi> No? that is very ≈øtrange, the A≈ø≈øertion is plain enough in Bi≈øhop <hi>Sander≈øon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and all them that wrot upon the point; and one would have thought the practice of all the re≈øt was a very good proof of their Sentiments in this matter; can any man believe, that men would lo≈øe their lives and e≈øtates, and expo≈øe them≈øelves to the greate≈øt difficulties and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities for not doing what they thought they lawfully might do? And in ≈øuch a ca≈øe to call for proofs is to abu≈øe mens patience, and in the Drs. language <hi>argues great perver≈øene≈øs of mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all the whole advice in this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph is nothing to the purpo≈øe, I brought the examples of the≈øe great men, again≈øt the Drs. Principles and Interpretations; and he advi≈øes me to con≈øider, whether they acted upon my Principles; and what is that to the purpo≈øe? if the Dr. can prove they did not act upon my Principles, or that they acted upon Principles that are contrary to them, I am contented to own that their examples is an argument again≈øt my Principles, as they are now again≈øt his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. But this he will not meddle with, and in≈øtead of that, he is for advi≈øing me (I thank him) to prove it my ≈øelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another thing I ought to have con≈øider'd, he ≈øays is, <hi>when he re≈øolved to argue from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, he ≈øhould have carefully con≈øidered,

But when he does not name one, nor ≈øo much as offer at it, when he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly tells me, <hi>he ≈øhall not enter upon this Argument,</hi> but turns me over to ≈øome body el≈øe that will do wonders in this point no man knows when; to talk of <hi>more and greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,</hi> and the practice of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which his Reader mu≈øt find out as well as he can, and to confront the mo≈øt plain and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible examples with imaginary ones, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices in the Clouds; And after all the urging and provocation to name not one, and yet ≈øtill to in≈øi≈øt upon it, and cry there are <hi>more</hi> and <hi>greater.</hi> This is ≈øuch a way of <hi>vindicating</hi> as is as new as his <hi>Hypothe≈øis,</hi> and very well agrees with it, and if this be di≈øputing we ≈øhall never have done.</p>
            <p>Now the Dr. comes to con≈øider what I had ≈øaid further upon this head, I ≈øaid, <q>the Dr. owns that this is a Prejudice, and ≈øo it is,<note place="margin">Po≈øt≈ø. p. 14.</note> and a very con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable one; and I wonder what he hath ≈øaid to remove it, not one word to the purpo≈øe; he tells indeed of ≈øome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, but not one that is any difference as to the matter before us,</q> of <hi>Submi≈ø≈øion to <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Powers,</hi> and he replies, <hi>let us then try that.</hi> And in order to that he begins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to ≈øtate the matter ≈øo plain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 66.</note> 
               <hi>that our Author him≈øelf had he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øo much mind to it, ≈øhall not be able to mi≈øtake or mi≈ørepre≈øent it.</hi> And have I mi≈øtaken or mi≈ørepre≈øented it? That the Dr. would in≈øinuate, but then he ≈øhould have told me where and in what in≈øtances; that it ≈øeems is another Que≈øtion; however the Dr. is re≈øolved to have it ≈øo, or would per≈øwade a credulous Reader to believe it, tho he hath not named one particular wherein I have mi≈øtaken or mi≈ørepre≈øented him; and this will appear more fully upon examining what he ≈øays in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; he tells us, <hi>he mu≈øt fir≈øt premi≈øe that they are two different Que≈øtions, when it is lawful to ≈øubmit to <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurping Powers, and when 'tis a duty: 'tis lawful when we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der force as can compel us; 'tis a duty when the Government is throughly ≈øetled.</hi> Very well! This is the Drs. <hi>State of the matter</hi> now, but where hath he ≈øtated it ≈øo before? there is not a word of it, nor any ≈øuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinction in his <hi>Ca≈øe of Allegiance;</hi> and how then ≈øhould I know it? I ≈øuppo≈øe by In≈øpiration? and it is a pretty way of mi≈øtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mi≈ørepre≈øenting him, becau≈øe in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwering his <hi>Ca≈øe of Allegiance,</hi> I did not divine what he would ≈øay in his <hi>Vindication;</hi> But the truth is the Dr. <hi>mi≈øtook,</hi> he found the former <hi>≈øtate of the matter</hi> would not do, and if he had kept clo≈øe to that he could not have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered what had been objected to him, and therefore hath given a new ≈øtate of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion. And he might have ≈øaid ≈øo, and not by an in≈øinuating preface, have laid his own <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtakes</hi> at other mens doors. Let him ≈øhew me if he can, that he hath in this manner ≈øtated the Ca≈øe in his former Book; if not, why does he talk of <hi>mi≈øtaking</hi> and <hi>mi≈ørepre≈øenting it?</hi> Well! let us take his new State, and ≈øee what he can make of it. He tells us, <hi>while we are in this ≈øtate</hi> (under force) <hi>we may either ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or not ≈øubmit without ≈øin, and then that which mu≈øt turn the ≈øcale, are arguments from intere≈øt;</hi> and here is the ground of this new State, he had ≈øaid before, and it was objected to him,<note place="margin">Ca≈øe of Alleg. p. 48. Po≈øt≈ø. p. 15.</note> 
               <hi>That the Friends of Monarchy were bound in</hi> Intere≈øt <hi>to re≈øtore the King.</hi> And he did not know how to get off from it without inventing this new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinction,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107829:69"/> which yet will not ≈øerve his turn; for having applied what he ≈øaid before to tho≈øe times of U≈øurpation he adds; <hi>This is ≈øo far from le≈ø≈øening and reproaching their Loyalty, that it is greatly for the commendation of it, that when they were not bound in con≈øcience to ≈øubmit to tho≈øe <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpations, tho by ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion our Author intimates, they might have made better terms for them≈øelves, yet they rather cho≈øe to venture their lives and fortunes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtore the King, which is not, as our Author in≈øinuates</hi> to prefer their intere≈øt to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences <hi>in ≈øerving the King; but where Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience was not concerned to the contrary, to venture their</hi> intere≈øt, <hi>ther lives and fortunes to re≈øtore the King:</hi> Now here is a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant ≈øtate of the Ca≈øe</p>
            <p>For 1. The Dr. tells us, in ≈øuch a ≈øtate <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt is to turn the ≈øcale;</hi> and yet in the clo≈øe of his reply, he ≈øays, it was <hi>to venture their intere≈øts, lives and fortunes to re≈øtore the King;</hi> this looks very like a contradiction, for what does he mean by <hi>venturing their intere≈øts,</hi> but <hi>venturing</hi> the lo≈øs of them. And tho≈øe who might have pre≈øerved their <hi>intere≈øts</hi> by ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion to the U≈øurpations; and which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Dr. it was lawful for them to do, cho≈øe rather to <hi>venture their lives and fortunes to re≈øtore the King;</hi> i. e. in ≈øhort, they cho≈øe rather to hazard their lives and intere≈øts, than to pre≈øerve them. And if <hi>intere≈øt mu≈øt turn the ≈øcale,</hi> it is plain enough, that whatever Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience did, intere≈øt lay on the ≈øide of U≈øurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And when ≈øo many of the Nobility, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Clergy, were utterly undone for their ob≈øtinate Loyalty, in ≈øuch a Ca≈øe to talk of mens being Loyal for <hi>intere≈øt</hi> is to contradict common ≈øen≈øe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Dr gives an admirable account of the Grounds and Rea≈øons, why the Royal Party did not ≈øubmit to tho≈øe U≈øurpations, and that is not Con≈øcience but Intere≈øt; not but that they <hi>thought</hi> it lawful for them to ≈øubmit, but they refu≈øed it upon other accounts, even when they <hi>thought</hi> they lawfully might. But where had the Dr. this fine account? Is there the lea≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of it in any hi≈øtory of tho≈øe times? in any Pamphlet or di≈øcour≈øe concerning it? or did ever any man be≈øides the Dr. ≈øay it? there were ≈øome indeed, that thought or pretended to think they were mi≈øtaken, and they might <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> own tho≈øe U≈øurpations, and the Drs. argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from providence was urged for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe: But I think the Dr. is the fir≈øt that ever affirm'd that they them≈øelves thought ≈øo. Their general arguments were drawn from the Duty of Allegiance, the obligation of their Oaths, and the Laws of the Land, which plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port they thought Con≈øcience was concerned, and that it was unlawful to own tho≈øe U≈øurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions This therefore is nothing but fancy and imagination, and the Dr. ≈øays it without any ground in the World. He may make rea≈øons for him≈øelf, and coin new di≈øtinctions to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtifie them, but what warrant has he to make rea≈øons for other men? It is no wonder he makes thus hold with the Convocation, who can fa≈øten ≈øuch a ≈øen≈øe on the practices of tho≈øe <hi>loyal ≈øufferers,</hi> not only without any manner of foundation, but contrary to their expre≈øs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations: if we mu≈øt be making <hi>new Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the≈øes,</hi> and framing <hi>new Schemes</hi> of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ju≈øtifie our ≈øelves, let us prove them as well as we can; but for ≈øhame let us never inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle other men to them, who plainly acted by different Principles, and have as plainly declared their ≈øen≈øe to the contrary; if the Dr. thinks this imputation ≈øevere, let him acquit him≈øelf from it, by ≈øhewing if he can, but ≈øome <hi>few</hi> among tho≈øe many Loyal Sufferers, who thought <hi>Con≈øcience</hi> was not concern'd in the Ca≈øe, and that they thought it lawful to ≈øubmit, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Subjects to tho≈øe U≈øurpations, in oppo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their Legal King.</p>
            <p>And this is yet more extravagant, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the di≈ømal circum≈øtances of tho≈øe times, and to how many difficulties and fatal mi≈øeries, that Revolution expo≈øed the Loyal Party, a great part of which might have been prevented in particular men, if they would but have comply'd, and joyn'd them≈øelves to the U≈øurpers. In ≈øuch a Ca≈øe to Que≈øtion, whether they were acted by Principles of Con≈øcience, or to ≈øay that they thought Con≈øcience was not concern'd either way, is to ≈øcorn and abu≈øe their ≈øufferings, and makes them ≈øelf murderers, and de≈øtroyers, and lays all their de≈øolation and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in at their own doors; for what can ≈øuch men an≈øwer to God, them≈øelves, or their families, who ≈øuffer them≈øelves to be undone and peri≈øh, when they might lawfully have prevented it. And this is that admirable Character the Dr. (to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:107829:69"/> ≈øave his own Hypothe≈øis) hath found out for the≈øe noble and con≈øcientious Sufferers: He was charg'd with <hi>reproaching their Vertue and Loyalty;</hi> and to get him≈øelf off that, he hath reproach'd them as much on the other hand.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Dr. di≈øtingui≈øhes between <hi>when it is lawful, and when it is a duty to ≈øubmit,</hi> and applies this di≈øtinction to tho≈øe U≈øurpations, thereby intimating, that it was <hi>lawful,</hi> tho not a <hi>duty,</hi> for the Loyal Party to ≈øubmit to them. The con≈øequence is, they had no obligation in con≈øcience to King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>≈øecond;</hi> for if it was <hi>lawful</hi> for them to ≈øubmit and become Parties to the U≈øurpation, it was likewi≈øe law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them to di≈øcharge them≈øelves of King <hi>Charles,</hi> for they could not be the Subjects of both, and then they were not bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience to him; they might re≈øpect him for their own ends, and endeavour to re≈øtore him <hi>to better their condition</hi> (as the Dr. ≈øays) and for the ≈øake of their <hi>intere≈øt;</hi> but Duty they owed him none at all, they ow'd him ju≈øt as much as they ow'd <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and no more. He was charged with reproaching their <hi>Vertue and Loyalty,</hi> and he hath now fairly compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd the matter, and made them have no <hi>Loyalty</hi> at all. For I pray what kind of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty is that which is no duty? They might love and re≈øpect the King, or rather them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves; but to be <hi>loyal</hi> to him they could not, for that ari≈øes from Duty and Obligation, and 'tis mere name and complement when there is none. And thus that renowned Loyalty which the world had in ≈øo much veneration, is ≈øunk into ju≈øt nothing. Between the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ali≈øts and the other Party the ≈øcales were even in point of Con≈øcience, advantage might turn the ≈øcales, and the whole is re≈øolv'd into ≈øelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øhne≈øs and private intere≈øt. And what a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous account is this of that glorious ≈øcene of invincible Fidelity, Fortitude and good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience? It is much for the honor of an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the≈øis that it cannot be <hi>vindicated</hi> but at the expence of the glory and reputation due to the be≈øt Men and the be≈øt Practices: And which is yet more extraordinary, the Doctor would make us believe, <hi>that this is ≈øo far from le≈ø≈øening and reproaching their Loyalty, that it is greatly for the commendation of it;</hi> yes ≈øure it is greatly for the <hi>commendation</hi> of a mans Loyalty, that he loves him≈øelf, and can <hi>better his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> by it. This may ≈øuit well enough with ≈øome mens <hi>Loyalty;</hi> but the <hi>Loyalty</hi> between 42 and 60 was quite of another make, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto the World hath thought that the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation</hi> of it con≈øi≈øted in ≈øuffering for their Fidelity, in parting with their Intere≈øts rather than their Loyalty, in ≈øubmitting to the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt Circum≈øtances rather than violating their natural and ≈øworn Allegiance.</p>
            <p>The Dr. adds now, <hi>That they were not bound in con≈øcience to ≈øubmit to the≈øe U≈øurpers.</hi> (The Que≈øtion is whether the Doctor's Principles and Arguments do not equally conclude for their Submi≈ø≈øion to tho≈øe <hi>U≈øurped Powers?</hi>) and this he ≈øays <hi>he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And here the Dr. takes a great deal of pains to prove that the <hi>Rump</hi> and <hi>Cromwell</hi> had no ≈øuch national con≈øent,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 40, 41.</note> and therefore their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not throughly ≈øetled. To which I an≈øwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all the Doctor's Arguments equally conclude for Submi≈ø≈øion to tho≈øe U≈øurpations as to any other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they might be ≈øetled according to the Doctor's notion of a Settlement, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding what he hath oppos'd to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

This Settlement (≈øuch as it is) the <hi>Rumpers</hi> and <hi>Cromwell</hi> had, for they were po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd of the Government, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtred the Power, and made Laws, and govern'd the People. And we may take the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107829:70"/> Doctor's remark along with us to confirm the point. <hi>It argues great perver≈øene≈øs of mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that ≈øen≈øe of the Word which is proper to the Subject to which it is apply'd.</hi> That is, it is very perver≈øe to ≈øay, that the Settlements of U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation are any other than the Settlements of Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion. And then I doubt it mu≈øt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe be <hi>perver≈øe</hi> to ≈øay that the <hi>Rumpers</hi> and <hi>Cromwell</hi> were not <hi>≈øetled</hi> Governments.

               <note place="margin">P. 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>Now</hi> (≈øays he) <hi>this is matter of fact, not of Right: and therefore the ≈øettlement of ≈øuch Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations is an</hi> actual <hi>not a legal Settlement of them. And actual and vi≈øible Settlement is all that is requir'd to an actual and vi≈øible tran≈ølation of Kingdoms.</hi> Is that <hi>all</hi> that is requir'd? Then they had <hi>all</hi> that is requir'd; for their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments were as <hi>actual</hi> and <hi>vi≈øible</hi> as any other: <hi>Cromwell</hi> for ≈øome years po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd the Government, and dy'd in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of it, and left the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion to his ≈øon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as far as <hi>actual</hi> and <hi>vi≈øible</hi> will go, it is as good a Plea for tho≈øe U≈øurpations as for any other. This is what the Doctor offers in proof to ju≈øtifie his Notion of a <hi>Settlement,</hi> and which in all re≈øpects <hi>fits Cromwell ju≈øt as if it had been made for him.</hi> And if they are Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ≈øufficient to prove a Settlement, then they likewi≈øe prove that <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ≈øuch a Settlement.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:107829:70"/> Doctor to prove his Expo≈øition argues thus; <hi>When the Apo≈øtle ≈øays</hi> All power is of God, <hi>there is no rea≈øon to confine this to all le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Powers, unle≈øs it were evidently the Doctrine of Scripture that U≈øurped Powers are not of God, which is ≈øo far from being true, that the contrary is evident.</hi> And this is a rea≈øon directly again≈øt all that he ≈øays here, <hi>When the Apo≈øtle ≈øays</hi> All Power is of God, <hi>there is no rea≈øon to confine this to all Powers</hi> con≈øented to by the People, <hi>unle≈øs it were evidently the Doctrine of the Scripture, that Powers without the con≈øent of the people are not of God, which is ≈øo far from being true, that the contrary is evident.</hi> And the con≈øequence is, That this Precept is to be interpreted of all U≈øurpers, or of none, and the Dr. mu≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it of the <hi>Rump</hi> and <hi>Cromwel,</hi> or di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his Argument as in≈øufficient. And let the Dr. at his lei≈øure ≈øhew me where in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <hi>All Power</hi> and the <hi>Pre≈øent Powers</hi> and the obedience to them is limited to a national Con≈øent, or where there is ≈øuch a di≈øtinction that the <hi>higher Powers</hi> by the con≈øent of the People ought to be obey'd, and the higher Powers without their con≈øent may not; if he will not undertake it, all his Argument from a national con≈øent ≈øignifies nothing, if he will he mu≈øt renounce with a witne≈øs. But the truth is, This bu≈øine≈øs of the <hi>Peoples Con≈øent</hi> ≈øeems to me to be put in for no other end, but to ≈øtop the mouth of an Objection, which the Dr. fore≈øaw would open wide upon him, but does not at all concern his <hi>Hypothe≈øis</hi> which ≈øtands or falls without any manner of relation to it. For how come the People to have any ≈øhare in God's Providence in ≈øetting up Kings? or what have they to do with Gods Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? or how comes it to pa≈øs that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent makes it a duty to obey God's Authority, and their di≈ø≈øent makes it no duty? Tho≈øe men indeed that ≈øay that all Power is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the People, and that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øume it, and di≈øpo≈øe it as they plea≈øe, for them to ≈øay that the con≈øent of a People ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles a Government or makes it, is agreeable enough to their Principles, and the People derive to the per≈øons governing the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that is originally in them≈øelves. But for them that maintain it as a Principle that all ≈øovereign Authority is of God, to talk of the Peoples con≈øent as nece≈ø≈øary to make Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence a duty to that Authority, is a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and it is a fine Doctrine to ≈øay that the Authority is deriv'd from God, but the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it is deriv'd from the Peoples own con≈øent. And this it ≈øeems was the ca≈øe here, for the Dr. tells us with re≈øpect to tho≈øe U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, that it was <hi>lawful</hi> to ≈øubmit to them, tho they were not bound in con≈øcience to do it. Now if it was lawful for them to ≈øubmit and become Subjects to tho≈øe U≈øurpations, then they had God's Authority; for it is not <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to become Subjects to per≈øons who have not God's Authority, if they were not bound in Con≈øcience, then their obedience to God's Authority depended purely upon their own con≈øent: And that is, God by his Providence gives the U≈øurpers Authority, and the People by their Con≈øent make it a duty to obey it. And ≈øo the matter is divided; the Authority of Government is from God, and the duty of the People from them≈øelves. If the Dr. hath a mind to deliver his pre≈øent Argument from the≈øe con≈øequences, let him give ≈øome other account of the Peoples con≈øent, and I am afraid it mu≈øt come to one of the≈øe two, either that U≈øurpers have not God's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or if they have, then the Peoples con≈øent is not nece≈ø≈øary to make obedience a duty: if the fir≈øt, then his Hypothe≈øis, and mo≈øt part of his two books, ≈øignifie nothing; if the la≈øt, then all that he ≈øays on the pre≈øent head ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies as little.</p>

            <p n="2">2. His ≈øecond Rea≈øon is, <hi>Nor were they the Repre≈øentatives of the Nation, but only of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Party and Faction;</hi> and his rea≈øon of that is, <hi>for that Artic.</hi> 14. (of the In≈øtrument) <hi>'tis provided no per≈øons aiding, advi≈øing, a≈ø≈øi≈øting, or abetting in the War again≈øt the Parliament ≈øince</hi> 41. <hi>unle≈øs they had been ≈øince in the Parliaments Service, and given ≈øignal Te≈øtimonies of their good affections, ≈øhould give any Vote in the Election of Members.</hi> And what proportion did the≈øe bear to the whole Nation? Mo≈øt of tho≈øe that had been active in the Kings Service were fled, ≈øeveral turn'd to the Government and were within the Qualification; and how many were the re≈øt? certainly very few in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øon of the whole. So that notwith≈øtanding ≈øuch re≈øtriction, tho≈øe that were elected might repre≈øent the <hi>great Body</hi> of the Nation, which is all the Dr. requires to ≈øuch a Con≈øent. But here the Dr. objects again, <hi>That after ≈øuch Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they were not Parliament men, unle≈øs they were approved to be Per≈øons not di≈øabled by the major part of the Council;</hi> and accordingly he tells us, that many per≈øons who were return'd in the <hi>≈øecond</hi> Parliament were not approved, which occa≈øion'd a Remon≈øtrance ≈øub≈øcribed
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107829:71"/> by near a hundred. And what then? One Parliament I hope, is ≈øufficient to give the peoples con≈øent. The people in two years time (the di≈øtance between the two Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) might grow weary of the U≈øurpation, and ≈øend up Members of another temper; but what did that ≈øignifie to their choice before? were any of the fir≈øt Parliament ≈øecluded upon that account? That the Dr. does not ≈øay; but for that he tells us, <hi>The fir≈øt Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be very bu≈øie about the New Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (but in what particulars he does not ≈øay) <hi>but the Protector ≈øent for them into the Painted Chamber, and taught them better.</hi> Well! then they <hi>were better taught,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with him. And he before their next ≈øitting, appointed a New Te≈øt; and one branch of it was (as the Dr. repeats it) <hi>I do hereby freely promi≈øe and engage my ≈øelf to be true and faithful to the Lord Protector.</hi> And he tells that day one hundred and thirty Members took it, and for ought appears to the contrary, all the re≈øt took it afterwards. And is not this a pure argument, that they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent to his Government? I ≈øuppo≈øe becau≈øe they took an Oath to be <hi>true and faithful</hi> to him. And ≈øo the Dr. hath fairly prov'd his point.</p>
            <p>Well! however that be, it can never be deny'd, no not by the Doctor him≈øelf, but that a very great number did expre≈øly con≈øent? And what became of them? Why truly, according to him, they became Subjects; for it was <hi>lawful</hi> to ≈øubmit: and when they had ≈øubmitted, it became a duty to <hi>them,</hi> tho the re≈øt were free. So that all they that took the <hi>Engagement,</hi> were Subjects to the <hi>Rumpers;</hi> and all that took the Oath to <hi>Oliver,</hi> of otherwi≈øe expre≈øly con≈øented to his Government, were his Subjects, and the re≈øt were Subjects to King <hi>Charles,</hi> or rather to no body, but were in intere≈øt engag'd to him. And what a ≈øpecial Society have we got here? one part of the ≈øame Society are Subjects to one per≈øon, another part to another, or rather, ab≈øolutely free: one Party are oblig'd in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience and by their Oaths, to ≈øupport one Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment with their Lives and Fortunes the other Party are oblig'd by Intere≈øt (a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple found by experience, to be much ≈øtronger than Oaths or Con≈øcience) to pull it down, and to ≈øet up another; and according to their differing obligations, they were bound to cut one anothers Throats at the fir≈øt opportunity. Now the Dr. may call this a Humane Society if he plea≈øe; but it ≈øuits better by half with a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Wolves and Tygres. The Dr. has forgot,<note place="margin">Ca≈øe of Alleg. p. 38, 39.</note> that one of his principal Aruments for Submi≈ø≈øion to U≈øurpers, <hi>is the nece≈ø≈øity of Government to pre≈øerve Humane Societies; for Humane Societies mu≈øt not di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolve into a <hi>Mob,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>'s State of Nature.</hi> And yet it ≈øeems to an≈øwer an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, it mu≈øt di≈ø≈øolve into ≈øomething very like them. To ≈øerve that purpo≈øe, the Dr. <hi>≈øuppo≈øes</hi> that <hi>no man who con≈øiders it well, will call that a Civil Government, or a Civil Society, to which Authority and Obedience is E≈ø≈øential.</hi> But to ≈øerve another purpo≈øe, All Authority and Obedience is ≈øtated quite away, and they may ≈øubmit, or not ≈øubmit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ≈øin, <hi>i. e.</hi> there is a Society, <hi>where is neither King, nor Subject, no Authority to command, nor Duty to obey.</hi> When the Dr. is to prove ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to U≈øurpers, from the nece≈ø≈øities of Government to pre≈øerve Humane Societies; why then, <hi>if God will pre≈øerve Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society, we mu≈øt conclude, that when he removes one King out of the Throne, he gives his Authority to him whom he places there, for without Authority, Humane Societies mu≈øt disband; Power may tye men together a while, but can never unite them into a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Body, without the Bonds and Ligaments of Duty and Con≈øcience.</hi> But when the Dr. is for <hi>vindicating</hi> his Arguments from laying any Reproach on the Loyal Sufferers, <hi>then he ≈øtates the matter ≈øo plain, as no body can mi≈øtake or mi≈ørepre≈øent it:</hi> and that is, that we mu≈øt <hi>conclude</hi> no ≈øuch thing at all; we mu≈øt not <hi>conclude,</hi> that God has given his Authority to him that is placed on the Throne, and the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øities of Government for pre≈øervation of Humane Society, do not give Authority to him that governs, and lay an obligation of duty on the Subject,</hi> and Societies mu≈øt hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as well as they can. For <hi>there are no Bonds and Ligaments of Duty and Con≈øcience.</hi> For he tells us very expre≈øly, <hi>that the Subjects were not in tho≈øe days bound <hi>in Con≈øcience</hi> to ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi>

And I doubt I had very good rea≈øon to make this An≈øwer, <q>I hope the being di≈øabled to keep a Living, e≈øpecially if it be a good one, is not a ≈øufficient Rea≈øon to rebel.</q> The Dr. is plea≈øant in his Reply, and tells me, <hi>he would de≈øire me carefully to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider it, for it did not concern them.</hi> Very well! but it concerns him, or el≈øe his rea≈øon above, is very ridiculous: for if men may refu≈øe to ≈øubmit, when it is a duty, becau≈øe they cannot hold a good Living according to the Con≈øtitutions of the Church: Then I doubt it follows, that Civil Duty is to be mea≈øur'd, not by a <hi>Thorough Settlement,</hi> but by <hi>Eccle≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈øtical Preferments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another difference the Dr. mention'd, was, <hi>The whole Government in Church and State was overturn'd, which was the Fundamental Con≈øtitution of the Nation.</hi> I an≈øwer'd, <q>This was but changing the Form of Government; and the <hi>Convocation</hi> ≈øpeaks of <hi>Degenerate Forms of Government;</hi> and U≈øurped Powers are not to be limited to a King, but to a Government; and the u≈øurping upon the Lords and Commons, as well as upon the King, is but U≈øurpation ≈øtill.</q> He replyes, <hi>I grant it, but when ≈øuch degenerate Forms are not thoroughly ≈øettled, the ≈øubver≈øion of the Fundamental Con≈øtitution, is a rea≈øonable prejudice again≈øt ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, when it is not a duty.</hi>

In his <hi>Ca≈øe of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,</hi> he mentions a great many differences; and I had ≈øuited my An≈øwers to them, and ≈øhew'd they made no difference in the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and when he comes to <hi>reply,</hi> he gives one Reply to them all. And that is, that all his differences are come to one ≈øingle diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; and the Que≈øtion at la≈øt is come into a narrow compa≈øs; and with re≈øpect to the duty of Submi≈ø≈øion to U≈øurped Powers, the Que≈øtion is not, whether they attain the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurpation by Villanies, or by barbarous u≈øage of hone≈øt and loyal people, or by encroachments on the Church, and the per≈øecution of its members, or by overturning the Legal Con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; but the ≈øingle Que≈øtion is, whether the Government be ≈øettled, and all the re≈øt ≈øignifie nothing to the Argument.

            </p>
            <p>I am now come to my Parting Objection in the <hi>Po≈øt≈øcript,</hi> of which the Dr. gives us this fair account,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 71.</note> That <hi>it is ≈øo very ridiculous, that had he begun with it, I ≈øhould have thought he had only intended it for a Je≈øt; but I am now ≈øo well acquainted with his way of rea≈øoning, that I am ≈øatisfied he is capable of thinking it an Argument.</hi> Upon my Word, this is very big; and a man would imagine, there was ≈øomething very wretched and trifling in the Argument. But I am ≈øo well acquainted with his way of replying, that I am confident here is ≈øomething he cannot an≈øwer, and therefore it is to be run down with ≈øcorn and contempt. If Arguments will not be an≈øwer'd, let them be hooted at; and perhaps with ≈øome Readers, that may do as well: and tho I do not believe, that the Dr. is capable of thinking, that ≈øuch things are An≈øwers; yet I do not know, but he may be capable of thinking, that ≈øome people may take lofty and ≈øcornful words, for good and plain An≈øwers. Well! let us ≈øee how <hi>ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> the Drs. An≈øwer makes it.</p>
            <p>The Argument is this, <q>If po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er contrary to Law,<note place="margin">Po≈øt≈øcript, p. 15.</note> be Gods Authority, and ought to be obey'd, then what≈øoever Sovereign Power a Prince po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øes him≈øelf of, is likewi≈øe God's Authority, &amp; ought to be obey'd.</q> He an≈øwers, <hi>But where do I ≈øay, that po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Sovereign Power contrary to Law, is God's Authority?</hi> A plea≈øant Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion, Where did he not ≈øay it? It is but all over his Book: What is U≈øurpation, but po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øion of power <hi>contrary to Law?</hi> And if the Dr. hath any other definition of it, he would do well to produce it. But for a man who writes a Book, to ju≈øtifie ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to <hi>Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurped Powers,</hi> as having <hi>God's Authority,</hi> to ask me, where he ≈øaid, <hi>that po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Sovereign Power contrary to Law, is God's Authority,</hi> is a <hi>Je≈øt</hi> indeed. But here the Dr. is very angry, as if I had done him ≈øome wrong, and tells me, <hi>I do not pretend that he ≈øaid it in expre≈øs words, but this I ≈øuppo≈øe is the ≈øen≈øe of what he ≈øays:</hi> and adds, <hi>But I de≈øire he would keep to my words, for I will an≈øwer for none of his ≈øen≈øes, unle≈øs I were better ≈øatisfied both of his under≈øtanding and hone≈øty.</hi> Now I do not de≈øire the Dr. ≈øhould an≈øwer for any of my ≈øen≈øes, unle≈øs he could an≈øwer a little better for his own. Let him but an≈øwer for his own, and I will be ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; but he will not do that. And I mu≈øt tell him, that <hi>denying</hi> his ≈øen≈øe, is not an≈øwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for it. For for all his impertinent Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domontade, that which I have ≈øaid, is his ≈øen≈øe, or el≈øe his Book is not his ≈øen≈øe: for what does he mean by <hi>Illegal Powers,</hi> but <hi>powers contrary to Law?</hi> And (which is the <hi>Cream of the Je≈øt</hi>) he immediately adds, <hi>I ≈øay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that a Prince who is ≈øettled in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Sovereign Power, tho he have no Legal Title to the Crown, has God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; i. e.</hi> he ≈øays the ≈øame thing, that he makes ≈øuch a terrible ≈øwaggering at me for ≈øaying: for ≈øays he, <hi>and what then? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Sovereign Power contrary to Law, is God's Authority, how does this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low?</hi> And how does it otherwi≈øe then follow? For what I pray is <hi>a Prince not having a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Title,</hi> but a Prince <hi>contrary to Law?</hi> and what is ≈øuch a Princes <hi>po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion</hi> of Sovereign Power, but the <hi>po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of it contrary to Law?</hi> And if he hath God's Authority by vertue of his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Sovereign Power contrary to Law, then it follows that po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Sovereign Power contrary to Law, is God's Authority. And does not he tell us,<note place="margin">Vind. p. 46.</note> 
               <hi>That the Authority of Government, is always God's Authority:</hi> And what does he mean by Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Sovereign Power? And what hath he to ≈øay to this? He adds, <hi>Cannot God ≈øettle a King upon the Throne, without a Legal Title, but he mu≈øt be
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107829:73"/> pre≈øumed to give him Authority, whenever he has power, to govern by an arbitrary will, again≈øt the Laws of the Land? Cannot God make a King, without giving him Authority to do all that he has power to do?</hi> Now the Dr. has the be≈øt faculty of turning his Que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ever I ≈øaw, when he is to prove, that God gives his Authority to Illegal and U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped powers; then the Que≈øtion is, <hi>Cannot God make a King without a Legal Title? Is God confin'd to Humane Laws in making Kings?</hi> And when he is to prove, that the≈øe U≈øurpers are to govern according to Law, then he is for asking, <hi>Cannot God ≈øet up a King, without a Legal Title, but he mu≈øt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øum'd to give him Authority to govern again≈øt the Laws of the Land?</hi> No doubt but God can do both; but that is not the Que≈øtion. And if we mu≈øt an≈øwer by Que≈øtions, his Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion plainly turns upon him, Cannot God make a King, without confining him to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern by the Laws of the Land, as well as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Legal Title? No doubt he can do that if he plea≈øe. And this brings us to the merits of the Cau≈øe, which the Dr. would fain ≈øhift off. And the Que≈øtion is, if a Prince in a Limited Monarchy, po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øes him≈øelf of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Sovereign Power, and actually admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters it contrary to Law, whether according to his Principles he hath not God's Authority, and ought to be obey'd, and we have not the ≈øame Evidence that he hath it that we have, that U≈øurped Powers have God's Authority. And that is <hi>Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion</hi> and <hi>Providence:</hi> and if we mu≈øt pre≈øume, that God gives his Authority to an U≈øurper, who is in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Sovereign Power contrary to Law, I would fain ≈øee a Rea≈øon why we mu≈øt not pre≈øume, that God gives his Authority to a Prince, who po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øes and exerci≈øes Arbitrary Sovereign Power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law? And if the Law mu≈øt be our Rule, again≈øt the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Arbitrary Power, why is it not al≈øo our Rule, again≈øt U≈øurped Powers? The one is as con≈øi≈øtent with Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power, as the other: The one God may give as well as the other; &amp; the Evidence that God does ≈øo, is the ≈øame in both. The one is as contrary to the Law as the other; and the denyal of it, as much confines God to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws as the other. And here my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment plainly affects him, which he takes no manner of notice of; <q>The a≈ø≈øuming an <hi>Illegal</hi> Power,<note place="margin">Po≈øt≈øcript, p. 16.</note> is no more again≈øt the Laws, than <hi>Illegal</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurped</hi> Powers: And God, when he gives Authority, is confin'd to our Laws and Con≈øtitutions, no more in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Power, than in the Per≈øon; and the only Evidence that we have that God gives it, is the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of it by Providence; and what≈øoever Power a Prince is po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd of, hath the ≈øame Evidence; and con≈øequently is a branch of the ≈øame Authority. And <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power</hi> is not incon≈øi≈øtent with the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Sovereign Power,</hi> and whatever limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Government there are now in the World, they are only limitations made by Humane Laws, and of no force again≈øt God's Authority.</q> But this it ≈øeems was ≈øo <hi>very ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,</hi> that the Dr. had not one ≈øingle word to ≈øay to it. And I mu≈øt tell him, that I am not only <hi>capable</hi> of thinking it an argument again≈øt him, but I am <hi>capable of</hi> thinking it ≈øuch an argument as he cannot an≈øwer, without quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ≈øome of his Principles. And becau≈øe he de≈øpi≈øes it ≈øo much, I do here provoke him to it. And in the mean time, 'tis <hi>very ridiculous,</hi> to ≈øcorn an argument; and when he comes to an≈øwer it, to leave out the whole ≈øtrength and force of it.</p>
            <p>The Rea≈øon I added to confirm my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was, <q>For the formal Rea≈øon of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ≈øuch a Prince, is, becau≈øe he hath God's Authority; and the Evidence that he hath that Authority, is, becau≈øe he is po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of Sovereign Power.</q> He an≈øwers, <q>
                  <hi>Suppo≈øe this, tho God's Authority be the formal rea≈øon of our obedience to a Prince, yet it is not the Rule of our obedience.</hi>
               </q> Very well! Then the <hi>Law</hi> is our Rule: and why I pray, is not the <hi>Law</hi> our Rule, with re≈øpect to the Per≈øon, as well as with re≈øpect to the duty we owe him. The Law directs to the Per≈øon, as well as to the duty, and directs the duty <hi>only</hi> to that Per≈øon: By the Law a Prince ought not to have <hi>Arbitrary Power;</hi> and by the ≈øame Law, an U≈øurper ought to have no power at all. If therefore the <hi>Law</hi> be our Rule, for the ≈øame rea≈øon that we ought not to obey the acts of <hi>Illegal Power,</hi> we ought not to obey <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurped Powers</hi> at all.<note place="margin">Vindic p. 72.</note> But the Dr tells us, <hi>The Authority of God, is
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107829:74"/> only an authority to govern according to the Laws of God and Nature, or the Laws of the Land.</hi> Now the Doctor knows well enough, that in this Argument I oppo≈øe <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Sovereign Power, not to the Laws of God and Nature, but to the Laws of the Land, even in the ≈øame ≈øen≈øe the Dr. under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtands <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurped Powers;</hi> and if po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law, gives Authority to U≈øurpation, why not to Arbitrary Power? But that I doubt, is a <hi>Ridiculous</hi> Que≈øtion too: for men do not love to be ask'd more Que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than they can an≈øwer. He adds, <hi>Tho Sovereign Princes may have ≈øuch an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as mu≈øt not be re≈øi≈øted, yet in a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Monarchy, they have no more Authority from God to tran≈øgre≈øs the Laws of the Land, than in an Ab≈øolute Monarchy, to tran≈øgre≈øs the Laws of God and Nature.</hi> The Propo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion couch'd in the≈øe words, is this, <hi>That in a Limited Monarchy, a Power that tran≈øgre≈ø≈øeth the Laws of the Land, is not God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> And then farewel to U≈øurpation, that has not God's Authority: For the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of U≈øurped Powers, is a fundamental tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion of the Laws of the Land. And if men have no Authority from G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>d to tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs the Laws of the Land, then an U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hath no Authority at all. Arbitrary Power tran≈øgre≈ø≈øeth the Laws of the Land, and therefore it is not God's Authority; and U≈øurpation tran≈øgre≈ø≈øeth it ten times more: and therefore, if the Rea≈øon be good, that al≈øo is not God's Authority. He goes on, <hi>indeed Arbitrary Government is not the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Sovereign Power, which is God's Authority, but the Arbitrary Exerci≈øe of it.</hi> What does he mean by this? Is not Arbitrary Power God's Authority in an Ab≈øolute Monarchy, as well as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited power in a Limited Monarchy? If he means this, he ought to have prov'd it; and he may yet prove it, if he thinks it will help his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the≈øis. But <hi>it is the Arbitrary Exerci≈øe of it:</hi> Of what, of <hi>God's Authority,</hi> or of <hi>Sovereign Power?</hi> If Arbitrary Government, be the Arbtrary Exerci≈øe of God's Authority, then it ought to be obey'd; for God's Authority ought to be obey'd, in what manner ≈øoever it is exercis'd. It or Sovereign Power, then I de≈øire to know, why the <hi>Arbitrary Exerci≈øe</hi> of Sovereign Power, is not the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of <hi>Arbitrary So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power,</hi> as well as the <hi>Exerci≈øe</hi> of a Limited Power, is the <hi>Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion</hi> of that Power. The Dr. tells us over and over, of the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful efficacy of <hi>Actual Government, Actual Authority, Actual Admini≈øtration,</hi> which are but other words for the <hi>Exerci≈øe</hi> of it; and which are the only Evidences that God gives it, and 'tis that whereby God inve≈øts them with it. And why is not the <hi>Actual Exerci≈øe of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power,</hi> or the Arbitrary Exerci≈øe of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power (for I know no difference) as well the Evidence that God gives it, and ≈øigns of his inve≈øting them with Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as Actual Government, and Actual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtration is an evidence, that God gives to them that Government they actually admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter. Arbitrary Government, not confin'd by Humane Laws, is one kind of Government, and a Government limited by Humane Laws, is another kind; and why is not actual admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtration, an equal Evidence, that God gives one, as well as the other, that he makes a Legal King an Ab≈øolute Monarch, as well as that he makes a Per≈øon who hath no Right, a Sovereign Prince? He that u≈øurps upon the Rights of his people, is no more an U≈øurper, and generally much le≈øs, than he that u≈øurps upon the Rights of the Prince: The Drs. main Principle of Providence, and his main Arguments to prove it make no difference. And it is a little my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtical, and mu≈øt ≈øo remain, till the Dr. explains it, why the very ≈øame Rea≈øons will not make it a duty to ≈øubmit to Arbitrary Power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws of the Land, as well as to ≈øubmit to U≈øurped Powers contrary to the ≈øame Laws. He adds, <hi>And tho we mu≈øt obey God's Authority, it does not hence follow, that we mu≈øt obey the exerci≈øe of Arbitrary Power.</hi> Now I wi≈øh he had given us a rea≈øon for this, and then we ≈øhould have ≈øeen the force of his An≈øwer. I confe≈øs, becau≈øe <hi>we mu≈øt obey God's Authority, it does not follow, that we mu≈øt obey the Exerci≈øe of Arbitrary Power:</hi> And what is the Rea≈øon? Becau≈øe the Exerci≈øe of Arbitrary Power in a Limited Monarchy is contrary to the Laws of the Land, and ≈øo is U≈øurpation too: and if that be a good rea≈øon again≈øt our obedience to Arbitrary Power, 'tis as good a Rea≈øon again≈øt our obedience to U≈øurpers</p>
            <p>He goes on, <hi>And yet I do not attribute God's Authority (which we mu≈øt obey in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience) to the bare po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Power,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107829:74"/> but to the ≈øettled po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of it, that is, with the con≈øent and ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and could a Prince change a Limited into an Ab≈øolute Monarchy by a National Con≈øent, Subjects were then as much bound in con≈øcience to ≈øubmit to an Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power, as they are now to obey the Laws, but then this would not be an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority again≈øt Law, but the Law would be changed.</hi> And this I had ≈øaid before, and draw'd an Inference from it: <q>That an Illegal Power is not throughly ≈øettled,<note place="margin">Po≈øt≈øcript, p. 17.</note> nor does bind the Subject to obedience, 'till it becomes Legal; for a National Con≈øent may part with the Rights of a Nation, as well as the con≈øent of a Prince may part with his own Rights.</q> But this was very ridiculous too: for the Dr. did not think fit to take notice of it, tho it plainly confutes his notion of the <hi>Peoples Con≈øent.</hi> The people may pa≈øs away their own Rights; but what have they to do with the Government, and to give away the Rights of that? And why may not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent of the Prince, part with the Rights of his People; as well as the Con≈øent of the People, part with the Right of the Prince? And a man may as well ≈øay, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent of one man, may give away the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of another, as to ≈øay, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent of the People, may di≈øpo≈øe of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Rights of a Prince again≈øt his own Con≈øent. And here is the plain diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the Con≈øent of the People to Arbitrary Power, makes that a Legal Government, and there is no wrong done; but the Con≈øent of the People to U≈øurpation, violates the Rights of the Legal Prince, and defrauds him of what by Law is his due.</p>
            <p>He proceeds, <hi>But do not I ≈øay, that when the Laws of the Land contradict the Laws of God, they are no Rule to us, but their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mu≈øt give place to Divine Authority.</hi> He ≈øhould (≈øays he) have cited the whole, <hi>That the Laws of the Land are the Rule of Con≈øcience, when they do not contradict the Laws of God; but when they do, they are no Rule to us; So that the Laws of the Land mu≈øt be the Rule of our obedience to Princes, unle≈øs they contradict the Laws of God, and I do not know that any of our Laws do that,</hi> Say you ≈øo? then the Laws of Succe≈ø≈øion mu≈øt be the Rule of our obedience; and we mu≈øt obey none but the Legal King. And he mu≈øt find out a new notion of Contradiction, before he can prove, that the Laws of Succe≈ø≈øion in an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Monarchy, contradict the Laws of God.</p>
            <p>He adds, <hi>It is a certain truth, as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor mu≈øt confe≈øs, that if the Laws of the Land contradict the Laws of God, they are no Rule to us: But this proves nothing in particular, without proving the Laws of the Land are contrary to the Laws of God. If then he can prove, that by the Law of God we are bound to obey the Arbitrary Will of the Prince again≈øt the Laws of the Land whenever he will command things again≈øt Law, and has power to cru≈øh us, if we will not obey, I will readily grant, and ≈øo mu≈øt he, that it is our duty to do it; but 'till he prove this, he mu≈øt not take it for granted, there is ≈øuch a Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here we have a ≈øtrain of the Drs admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Ingenuity. An unwary Reader may be apt from hence to conclude, that the De≈øign of my Argument <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re, had been to prove, that it was a duty to obey Arbitrary Power again≈øt the Laws of the Land; whereas it is the clean contrary, and proceeds upon the ≈øuppo≈øition, that it is not a duty: and from thence I ≈øhew the ab≈øurdity of the Drs. Principles and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which equally conclude for ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to Arbitrary Power, as to U≈øurpation. And yet by a fine piece of dexterity the Dr. would thru≈øt the ab≈øurdities of his own Doctrines upon me, and by a ≈øhamele≈øs in≈øinuation make me appear to argue for obedience to Arbitrary Power, when I only argue from his Principles, and from thence ≈øhew the incon≈øequence and ab≈øurdity of his Arguments. For thus it follows in the Dr. <hi>What he means by this argument,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vind p 73.</note> 
               <hi>I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell; if he does think there is ≈øuch a Law of God, I ≈øuppo≈øe he intended in <hi>good earne≈øt</hi> to prove, that we mu≈øt ≈øubmit to the Arbitrary Will of the Prince, and to condemn the oppo≈øition that was made in the late Reign to ≈øuch arbitrary proceedings, if he did not believe there was any ≈øuch Law of God, how ridiculous was it to pretend that <hi>we mu≈øt</hi> ≈øubmit to Arbitrary Will and Power again≈øt Law, becau≈øe when the Laws of the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107829:75"/> Land contradict the Laws of God, they are no Rule to us.</hi> Now what kind of interpretation of the Convocation are we to expect from him, who deals thus with his Adver≈øaries? If contrary to all Ju≈øtice he can turn the ≈øen≈øe the clean contrary, to expo≈øe an argument, which he cannot an≈øwer, what wonder is it, if he wre≈øts the Convocation to ≈øerve his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothe≈øis. Does he act at this rate, and yet talk of the <hi>hone≈øty</hi> of his adver≈øary? Let him ≈øhew where I have play'd ≈øuch egregious tricks with any of his arguments, and I will bear the infamy, and ask his pardon to boot; but if he cannot, it returns double upon him, both in making a fal≈øe charge, and condemning his adver≈øary for that, of which him≈øelf is only guilty.</p>
            <p>For a conclu≈øion of this Point, I ≈øhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtow another <hi>Je≈øt</hi> upon the Dr. (which al≈øo <hi>I am capable of thinking an Argument</hi>) and it is rais'd from his New Hypothe≈øis of <hi>force,</hi>

               <q>We thought the Laws were our Rule, and they, their Statutes, and ≈øo it ≈øeems they were, <hi>if there were no greater force to di≈ø≈øolve the obligation.</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>Now I ≈øuppo≈øe, no body at that time di≈øputed K. <hi>J's</hi> power, <hi>or force,</hi> if he had only commanded them to choo≈øe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pre≈øident contrary to their Statutes and their Oaths, and had not been able to <hi>cru≈øh</hi> them if they refus'd, then the Statutes were their Rules, <hi>and their Oaths bound them,</hi> and they were oblig'd in Con≈øcience to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve them. But if he were able to <hi>cru≈øh</hi> them (as what he actually did, he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly able to do) <hi>then all their obligations ceas'd,</hi> and they might have obey'd his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand contrary to their Statutes and their Oaths, <hi>by vertue of the power and force he had in his hands to cru≈øh them and undo them.</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>Now here is the ≈øingle Que≈øtion, Had the Gentlemen of <hi>Magdalen Colledge</hi> comply'd with the Will and Power of the King contrary to their Statutes and Oaths, had they in ≈øo doing, been perjur'd?</q> If they had, <hi>then Laws and Oaths bind again≈øt force,</hi> and men are bound to ≈øtand by them, let the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons be never ≈øo able to cru≈øh them for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øal. And if <hi>that</hi> force, and ten times more, would not have excus'd them from perjury, had they comply'd; I wonder how it ≈øhould do it, in the greater and more publick in≈øtances. For, how comes an Oath to Local Statutes, to be of more force, than an Oath of Allegiance? or (as the Doctor ≈øpeaks in the in≈øtance of the <hi>Jews</hi>) than God's Covenant with his people? Or how the Statutes of a <hi>Colledge,</hi> ≈øhould be more obligatory, than the Laws of a Nation. Now we mu≈øt remember that this was the Ca≈øe of <hi>private Subjects,</hi> and of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Colledge, upon the account of which, the Dr. ≈øayes, <hi>Force will ju≈øtifie ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, and then it is much the ≈øame thing from what quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the force comes, when a man is under the power of a new Government, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not re≈øi≈øt, which will not protect him; nay, which will undo, and ruine him, if he will not ≈øubmit, 'tis all one,</hi> &amp;c.

And if this be the ca≈øe, Laws and Oaths may ≈øerve to talk on, but in truth are of very little u≈øe, and tend to very little purpo≈øe.</p>

                  <hi>when they have e≈øtabli≈øh'd any of the ≈øaid degenerate forms of Government among≈øt their own people,</hi> and then the Government may be throughly ≈øettled within it ≈øelf, before it have a peaceable po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion and ≈øettlement.</hi> The Dr. it ≈øeems was ≈øen≈øible, that he had not ≈øaid one word of an e≈ø≈øential branch of a <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Settlement,</hi> and that is <hi>peaceable Po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øion,</hi> free from the di≈øturbance of other Claims and Pretenders. To talk of a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, when the Right Owner puts in his Claim, and actually pro≈øecutes his Title, is to contradict the ≈øen≈øe of mankind. And he that will ≈øay, that a Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion without either Right or Peace, that when there is a di≈øpute about the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, but none at all about the Right or Title, is a <hi>Thorough Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> He may ≈øay any thing, and make words ≈øignifie what he plea≈øe: He may tell us if he will, that <hi>

And this I had told him before, <q>When there is a Pro≈øecution but of a pretended Right,<note place="margin">Po≈øt≈øcript, p. 2.</note> it cannot fairly be ≈øaid, that ≈øuch a po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øettled, but when there is a plain, vi≈øible, and indi≈øputable Legal Right again≈øt a Po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øor, and that Right actually pro≈øecuted, in ≈øuch a Ca≈øe to call bare po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion a <hi>Thorough Settlement,</hi> is one of the ≈øtrange≈øt things in the World.</q> But this the Dr. thought fit to let alone, and yet he ≈øayes but ju≈øt before, <hi>that he hath <hi>particularly</hi> an≈øwer'd all the little appearances of Rea≈øon and Arguments in the Po≈øt≈øcript:</hi> and methinks if this would not have pa≈øs'd with him for a <hi>Rea≈øon,</hi> it might at lea≈øt have gone for a <hi>little appearance of Rea≈øon,</hi> and might have been an≈øwer'd. Well! <hi>but the Convocation mean the Settlement of a Government within it ≈øelf, not with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect to foreign force and power.</hi> No doubt of it: for when a Prince and People have given up their Right and ≈øubmitted, what has a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power to do in the matter? And if the Dr. plea≈øe to prove, that the Natural and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal King is a foreigner, I ≈øuppo≈øe it may do his Argument ≈øome ≈øervice. But this is ju≈øt ≈øuch another Argument at this, if one man u≈øurps upon another's Right, and unju≈øtly po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øes him≈øelf of his E≈øtate, if the Right Owner can manage the Suit again≈øt him with his own Money, or with the Rent and Revenue of the E≈øtate, then the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor is not <hi>≈øettled</hi> in his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion; but if he borrows the money to manage it, then the other is as firmly ≈øettled as can be. But the Convocation expre≈øs it, <hi>when they have e≈øtabli≈øh'd any of the ≈øaid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate forms of Government amongst their <hi>own</hi> people.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Convoc. p. 57.</note> But that ≈øame <hi>own</hi> is his own; for it is not in the <hi>Convocation Book</hi> (which I note only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind the Doctor, that <hi>little particles</hi> may ≈ølip from his Pen, as well as from others; and may make him a little more cautious, how he treats his Adver≈øaries too ≈øeverely on that account). And what then? Why then they have not e≈øtabli≈øh'd the ≈øaid forms of Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt <hi>other</hi> people: And it would be an extraordinary E≈øtabli≈øhment indeed, if the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of a Government in <hi>England</hi> ≈øhould be e≈øtabli≈øh'd in <hi>China,</hi> or among the People of other Nations. And where I wonder ≈øhould a form of Government be e≈øtabli≈øh'd, but among the people where it is e≈øtabli≈øh'd. And this is all the my≈øterie of the bu≈øine≈øs, and all the Convocation meant by it. And what is this to the purpo≈øe? This ≈øhews indeed, that an E≈øtabli≈øhment among one people, is not an E≈øtabli≈øhment among another people; but this does not ≈øhew, that U≈øurpation, is an <hi>e≈øtabli≈øh'd</hi> Government by the con≈øent of the people, when there is an undoubted Right and Title a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually pro≈øecuted again≈øt it. But I think it ≈øhews, that the ≈øen≈øe of the Convocation is clean contrary, and the way of Expre≈ø≈øion, which the Convocation here u≈øes, ≈øeems a good argument again≈øt the Drs. interpretation; for had they thought that the <hi>Con≈øent of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> was the main or only thing that <hi>e≈øtabli≈øh'd</hi> and <hi>≈øetled</hi> any ≈øuch new Government, here was the faire≈øt occa≈øion to have expre≈øs'd it, and it can hardly be ≈øuppos'd they ≈øhould do otherwi≈øe; and had they been of the Doctor's mind, they mu≈øt have expre≈øs'd it thus, <hi>When they have e≈øtabli≈øh'd any of the ≈øaid degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate forms of Government <hi>by the con≈øent of the people.</hi>
               </hi> And I believe no fair Rea≈øon can be given, why they did not ≈øo expre≈øs it, if
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107829:77"/> they had believed it. The Dr. makes it a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon again≈øt the interpretation of a Thorough Settlement by the acqui≈øition of Right.<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 4.</note>

                  </gap>y ≈øaid, and had prevented all mi≈øtakes about it.</hi> And in the pre≈øent Ca≈øe, if this had been their meaning, it had not only been as ea≈øily ≈øaid (which proves nothing) but it had been unrea≈øonable not to have ≈øaid it. It had been the plain and natural expre≈ø≈øion of their ≈øen≈øe: and if they intended it, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable, why they ≈øhould not expre≈øs it. Here they ≈øpeak of the <hi>people,</hi> and with re≈øpect al≈øo to the E≈øtabli≈øhment of a New Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if the con≈øent of the people in their judgments, had been the only thing that e≈øtabli≈øh'd ≈øuch Governments, in all fair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction, it ought to have been expre≈øs'd, when the nature of the thing, the ≈øubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the form of expre≈ø≈øion, all directly lead them to it. But in≈øtead of that, all that they ≈øay, is, that ≈øuch New Governments are e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øh'd <hi>amongst their people,</hi> But not by them, nor by their con≈øent. And I think from thence, there is all the rea≈øon in the World to conclude, that it was not their ≈øen≈øe, that the Con≈øent of the people, was the only, or the main thing that ≈øettled a New Government. And this is one Argument more again≈øt the Drs. interpretation of the ≈øen≈øe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</p>
            <p>I now come to his Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 74.</note> of what I alledg'd out of Bi≈øhop <hi>Andrews</hi> and Bi≈øhop <hi>Buckeridge,</hi> two Members of this Convocation, and of Dr. <hi>Jackson,</hi> a Learned Divine of tho≈øe times, again≈øt the Drs. ≈øen≈øe of the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>Now here the Dr. tells me, <hi>The thing I am to prove from them is, that tho≈øe who a≈øcend the Throne by <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpation without a Legal Right, have not God's Authority, and mu≈øt not be obey'd, and that ≈øuch Princes can never in the ≈øen≈øe of the Convocation, be ≈øettled in their Thrones, or have God's Authority, 'till they gain ≈øome new Legal Right, by the Death or Ce≈ø≈øion of the Rightful Prince, or by a long Pre≈øcription.</hi> And what need is there of all this? It is not ≈øufficient again≈øt him and his ≈øen≈øe of the Convocation, if I prove from them, that U≈øurpers are no Kings, nor have God's Authority, nor have the duties of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects belonging to them? I did not cite them to ju≈øtifie my Rea≈øons (which yet would be ea≈øie enough to do) but again≈øt that interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.

            <p>The fir≈øt is Bi≈øhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> who was a very Learned Member of that Convocation, and under≈øtood the ≈øen≈øe of it as well as the Dr. and it is not very probable, that what he had, determin'd for Doctrine ≈øolemnly and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, be would contradict, and deliver the clean contrary in his particular Writings. I crave leave to cite the whole, becau≈øe the Dr. hath not, that ≈øo we may the better ≈øee the Drs. Eva≈øions. Upon the≈øe words, <hi>By me Kings reign</hi> (Prov. 8.15.) he tells, that the Act <hi>Regnant</hi> is twofold: <hi>Some are</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>Kings,</hi>

The Bi≈øhop ≈øayes, Joa≈øh <hi>was true King all tho≈øe ≈øix years he reigned not:</hi> and the Dr. an≈øwers, he was the true Heir, <hi>i. e.</hi> he was not the true King: for according to his Principles, there is as much difference between the <hi>true Heir,</hi> and the <hi>true King,</hi> as there is between ≈øomething and nothing; <hi>And</hi> Athaliah <hi>an <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper, tho ≈øhe reigned ≈øix years?</hi> Right! the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation does ≈øay ≈øo; and ≈øo does the Bi≈øhop, and ≈øo does the Doctor. But here is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the Bi≈øhop ≈øayes, <hi>Athaliah was never any true Queen,</hi> the Dr. ≈øayes ≈øhe was; and as true a Queen, as <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> was a King, bating on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the irre≈øi≈øtablene≈øs of her Authority; nay, in the matter now compar'd, ≈øhe was a true <hi>Queen,</hi> than <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> was a <hi>King;</hi> for, for tho≈øe ≈øix years ≈øhe was a <hi>true Queen,</hi> and <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> was only a <hi>true Heir, i. e.</hi> ≈øhe was Queen, and <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> was not King. A very fair Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! The Bi≈øhops words are, <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> was King, and <hi>Athaliah</hi> was not Queen all tho≈øe ≈øix years, and the Drs. ≈øen≈øe is, <hi>Athaliah</hi> was Queen, and <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> was not King all tho≈øe ≈øix years. And yet the <hi>Bi≈øhop might be of his mind, tho he would not allow them the name of Kings.</hi> Yes, ju≈øt as much as two per≈øons are of the ≈øame mind, who manife≈øtly contradict each other: What he adds about the Convocation's ≈øpeaking of a King <hi>de facto,</hi> and what Doctrine he hath prov'd from thence, I have an≈øwer'd already. But for him to ≈øay, that notwith≈øtanding his ≈øaying, that <hi>true Heirs who reign not, i. e.</hi> in the Drs. language are out of po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, are the true Kings, that U≈øurpers who reign, <hi>i. e.</hi> are in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne, are not true Kings; Bi≈øhop <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> might be of the <hi>≈øame mind with the Doctor</hi> as to obedience to ≈øuch U≈øurpers, is to ≈øuppo≈øe all his Readers out of their wits. For if any man can believe, that that Learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhop did think, that the Duties <hi>only</hi> belonging to a King, were due to a Per≈øon whom he thought to be no King, and were not due to the Per≈øon whom he thought was the King; it is high time to leave di≈øputing, and go range our ≈øelves in the Fore≈øt: For we mu≈øt give over communicating our minds, if the ≈øen≈øe of men cannot be learnt from the plaine≈øt Expre≈ø≈øions.</p>
            <p>The Dr. goes on, <hi>But the Bi≈øhop will not allow, that ≈øuch Kings</hi> (if he plea≈øes, ≈øuch U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurpers, and no Kings; for that is the Bi≈øhop's Expre≈ø≈øion) <hi>reigned by God.</hi> Right! <hi>But then he does not mean, that ≈øuch Kings do not <hi>exerci≈øe</hi> God's Authority; But that God did not by his antecedent will and app int<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, place them on the Throne.</hi> But how does the Dr. know that, or where had he this? Does the Bi≈øhop ≈øay, or in the lea≈øt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate any ≈øuch thing? No matter for that; the Dr. is re≈øolv'd to make him ≈øay ≈øo, becau≈øe it is for his purpo≈øe. And is not this a pure Interpreter of Authors? What Authority has he to make ≈øen≈øes for men, which they never made them≈øelves? He might have ≈øaid, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:107829:79"/> with the ≈øame Ju≈øtice and Truth, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhop when he ≈øaid, U≈øurpers were no Kings, he <hi>meant</hi> they were Kings, when he ≈øaid, they did not reign by God, he <hi>meant</hi> they did reign by him. Grant but this liberty, that men may clap their own <hi>di≈øtinctions</hi> upon others, and we may ea≈øily make them ≈øay what we plea≈øe: and at this rate the Dr. may make Bi≈øhops, or Convocations, or any body el≈øe, ≈øpeak what he hath a mind to. Let him ≈øhew if he can, where this di≈øtinction of <hi>Exerci≈øing God's Authority, tho not Reigning by him,</hi> and of his <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Will,</hi> are in Bi≈øhop <hi>Andrews.</hi> And if he can't, let him try if he can make another di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinction, to avoid the charge of <hi>inventing a ≈øen≈øe, and fa≈øtning it upon the Bi≈øhop, to ≈øerve his own turn.</hi>

Suppo≈øe St <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtom</hi> was of that mind, does it follow, that therefore the Bi≈øhop was? If this be not his meaning, what does he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand by his Particle <hi>[thus]?</hi> Well! but <hi>thus <hi>St.</hi>
               </hi> Chry≈øo≈øtom <hi>on the thirteenth to the</hi> Romans: why, doth St. <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtom</hi> ≈øay any thing, <hi>of ≈øuch Kings exerci≈øing God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, tho God did not by his antecedent will and appointment place them on the Throne?</hi> nor that neither; but the Dr. hath taken this di≈øtinction from Dr. <hi>Jackson,</hi> and fa≈øtned it upon Bi≈øhop <hi>Buckeridge</hi> and St. <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtom,</hi> tho neither of them ≈øay one word of it, nor any thing like it. And in truth, in reference to Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> him≈øelf, he both mi≈øtakes and mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applyes it, as we ≈øhall ≈øee pre≈øently. But as for St. <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtom,</hi> the Dr. tell us, <hi>he allows all power and authority to be of God, and to be ordained of God, and therefore ought not to be re≈øi≈øted, whoever has it: but yet will not ≈øay, that all Princes, who exerci≈øe this Power wickedly and tyrannically, whatever their Title be, are ordained of God.</hi> But where had the Dr. this? St. <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtom</hi> (as far as I can find) ≈øays nothing of this. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him, of <hi>whoever has this power:</hi> He ≈øayes indeed, the Apo≈øtle does not ≈øay, <hi>There is no Governour, but what is of God, but he ≈øpeaks of the thing it ≈øelf, there is no power but of God.</hi> And from whence I think it plainly follows, That a Governour, or in the Drs. words, one that actually governs, might not be of God, and con≈øequently, ≈øuch a one is not within the Precept of the Apo≈øtle, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to St. <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtom.</hi> But the Dr. gives a Rea≈øon, <hi>He</hi> (St. <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtom) thought it a reproach and blemi≈øh to the Goodne≈øs and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice of Providence, to ≈øay that wicked, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, tyrannical Princes, were ordained by God; but yet granted, that the Authority they exerci≈øed was God's, and mu≈øt be obey'd.</hi> But this is all his own, and a Rea≈øon he hath made for St. <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtom,</hi> to make him ≈øpeak what he thinks fit; for where does St. <hi>Chry≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtom</hi> ≈øay any thing <hi>of reproaching and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øhing the Ju≈øtice and Goodne≈øs of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence?</hi> And where does he ≈øay, that the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> exercis'd, <hi>was God's Authority, and ought to be obey'd,</hi> whatever the Per≈øons were; or as the Dr. ≈øayes before, <hi>whatever their Title be?</hi> Upon this the Controver≈øie turns, and St. <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtom</hi> hath not the lea≈øt word of it. And I believe any man that attentively con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders St <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtom,</hi> will find, that he delivers a Doctrine directly contrary to what the Doctor hath made for him. For he plainly intimates, that all Governours are not of God, tho Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment it ≈øelf is; and when he comes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this, he does it by an allu≈øion from Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; That <hi>a woman is joyned to a man by God, that is, by God's In≈øtitution of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, not that every one that co-habits with a Woman, is therefore joyn'd to her by God.</hi> Now if it will be admitted, that this allu≈øion explains St. <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtom</hi>'s meaning (and I think that cannot be doubted) then we have a pretty clear account of what he means, when he ≈øayes, all Governours are not ordain'd of God; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is of Divine In≈øtitution, as well as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: But as every man that co-habits with a woman in the Drs. phra≈øe, <hi>is in po≈ø≈øe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion,</hi> is not therefore joyn'd by God, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:107829:79"/> Doctor may as well ≈øay, that St. <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtom</hi> granted that any man that co-habits with a woman ought to be obey'd, and to have the duties belonging to a Husband pay'd to him, tho they are not joyn'd together by God, as that he grants, that a Governour exerci≈øes God's Authority, and ought to be obey'd, tho he will not allow that ≈øuch Governours are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd of God.</p>
            <p>The Doctor adds, <hi>The Bi≈øhop and others will allow what St.</hi> Chry≈øo≈øtom <hi>would not, that mo≈øt wicked Tyrants, who have a Legal Title,</hi>

               <hi>are ordain'd of God, but are afraid to own that Princes, who a≈øcend their Thrones by unju≈øt means, are ≈øet up by God; but it does not hence follow, that they deny'd their power and authority to be God's, or that Subjects ought to obey it.</hi> And he adds, <hi>the Convocation affirms no more in that mighty place.</hi> And then he concludes, <hi>≈øo that Learned men may differ in this point, whether illegal <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpers are placed in the Throne, by the over-ruling Coun≈øels and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God, or only by his permi≈ø≈øive Providence, and yet agree in the main Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion, That the Authority they exerci≈øe, when ≈øettled in their Thrones, is God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and mu≈øt be obey'd.</hi> Now this is a dextrous method of interpretation, and a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way to avoid the force of any Allegations. And Authors mu≈øt be very ≈øtiff and ≈øtubborn, if they will not yield and be brought over, when we may make di≈øtinctions for them, which they never made them≈øelves, and then draw a ≈øen≈øe for them out of our own Di≈øtinctions. The Que≈øtion is concerning the ≈øen≈øe of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhop <hi>Andrews:</hi> The Doctor cites St. <hi>Chry≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtom,</hi> to prove the Bi≈øhop's ≈øen≈øe; and to make that good, he ≈øayes, the <hi>Bi≈øhop</hi> and others will allow more than St. <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtom</hi> would; and at length concludes, <hi>That Learned Men may differ as to the placing an <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper on the Throne, whether by the Coun≈øel or permi≈ø≈øion of God, and agree in the main conclu≈øion, that they exerci≈øe God's Authority.</hi> But where I pray, is this difference? And where is this agreement? is there any thing like it in Bi≈øhop <hi>Andrews?</hi> Not a word of that. He tells us indeed, <hi>we have an expre≈øs determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this matter by Dr.</hi> Jack≈øon. And ≈øuppo≈øe we have, what is that to the purpo≈øe?

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:107829:81"/> it was not at all to the purpo≈øe for which I cited the Bi≈øhop.

               </q> ‚Äî Now that <hi>Author</hi> had ≈øaid nothing of the Peoples Con≈øent, and I was not concern'd to obviate a Notion which the <hi>Author</hi> with whom I had to deal had not mention'd nor in≈øi≈øted on.

And I dare be bold to ≈øay, that that <hi>Author,</hi> nor any man el≈øe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ever thought of it before, except it had been with thoughts of abhorrence: for 'tis a Notion with a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi> in the belly on't, and plainly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in <hi>Commonwealth</hi> Principles: for if the Con≈øent of the People can make Allegiance become a duty contrary to Laws and Oaths, their Di≈ø≈øent may make it no duty contrary to the ≈øame Laws and Oaths. If their Con≈øent can make one King, or (which is the ≈øame thing) make their Allegiance due to him when by the Laws and their Oaths they have obligations to another, they may make or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker Kings as often as they plea≈øe; for their con≈øenting to one is the di≈øcharging another, and at length all the bu≈øine≈øs of Governments will be re≈øolv'd into the Peoples Con≈øent.

            <p>But does not the Bi≈øhop ≈øay, <hi>That</hi> Athaliah <hi>had not acquir'd a Right to the Crown, neither by the Con≈øent of the People, nor by the Pre≈øcription of ≈øix years?</hi> Right, but what follows is not ≈øo, <hi>which ≈øhews what his judgment was that ≈øuch an U≈øurper as</hi> Athaliah <hi>might acquire a Right to the Crown, either by the Con≈øent of the People or long Continuance.

            <p>We are now come to matter of fact, the Ca≈øe of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third: And from what Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> ≈øays<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> the≈øe things are plain.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Richard</hi> the Third came to be inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øted with Royal Power by very indirect means.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That many Acts of Royal Power tho pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from him were legal.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That they that bore office under him, or obeyed his ≈øummons to Parliament did not re≈øi≈øt the Ordinance of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That it had been a ≈øin for any man <hi>of his own private head</hi> to have killed him. And this the Dr. hath put into great black letters, as if there were ≈øome very great matter in it: But in truth it is nothing at all, for I do not know that it is a Que≈øtion between us, whether any man <hi>of his own private head</hi> may kill an U≈øurper, whatever ≈øome learned men have ≈øaid about it. But this I can tell him, that Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øing it with this cautious limitation, plainly ≈øuppo≈øes that be thought it might be done by private men, tho not of their own private Heads. And therefore,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Every man is not Avenger of ≈øuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt the ordinance of God, i. e. of U≈øurpers, which plainly ≈øuppo≈øes that ≈øome men are: And Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> immediatly tells us who are, <hi>This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Higher Powers only, or unto them to whom the Supreme Power by right is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed,</hi> i. e. The Rightful Prince hath Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and is an Avenger of an U≈øurper. And ≈øo <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Richmond was authorized by God's Ordinance,</hi> i. e. he was the Right Heir for that the Dr. plainly means by <hi>God's Ordinance,</hi> (This indeed is a mi≈øtake in Hi≈øtory, but that is nothing to the Argument) and upon that account, had authority to execute vengeance on him; <hi>which every one might not, which perhaps no other might have done ≈øave only in his right and intere≈øt, and by his Commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion and Command;</hi> i. e. tho others may not do it of their own private heads, yet they may in the right and intere≈øt, and by the Commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion and Command of the Right Heir. And now we have it with the <hi>Conjunctive,</hi> and what hath the Dr. to ≈øay to it? he tells us, <hi>who ever doubted,</hi>

               <hi>but a Rightful Prince, when di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed unju≈øtly may recover his Throne if he can, and di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øs the <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper, or that tho≈øe who lawfully receive Commi≈ø≈øions from him may
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107829:83"/> lawfully fight in his quarrel. But the great Que≈øtion ≈øtill remains, whether Subjects may lawfully take Commi≈ø≈øion from the di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed Prince, to fight again≈øt the Prince, who is ≈øetled in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne; this Dr.</hi> Jack≈øon <hi>does not ≈øay, and therefore he can do our Author no ≈øervice.</hi> Right he does not ≈øay it, nor was there any rea≈øon for it, but this he ≈øays, that the Right Heir, or di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed Prince is the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> and it is a <hi>great Que≈øtion</hi> indeed, whether the Subjects may <hi>lawfully</hi> take a <hi>Commi≈ø≈øion</hi> from the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> and the in≈øtance makes this as clear as the Sun, Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> ≈øays, <hi>perhaps no other Per≈øon might have done it, ≈øave only in <hi>his</hi> right and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt, and by <hi>his</hi> commi≈ø≈øion and command;</hi> and in who≈øe right and intere≈øt, &amp;c. did he mean? why truly in the right and intere≈øt, and by the commi≈ø≈øion and command of <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond;</hi> and who I pray were the men that took Commi≈ø≈øions of him, and fought for him? why truly no body el≈øe, but the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> even at the ≈øame time that the U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per actually governed; and then the Subjects may lawfully take Commi≈ø≈øions from the Right Heir, to fight again≈øt the Prince, who is ≈øetled in the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne. The truth is any man who is not concern'd it ≈øhould mean otherwi≈øe, will ea≈øily ≈øee, that what Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> here obviates is the re≈øi≈øting or killing an U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of a mans <hi>own private head,</hi> but by no means to prejudice the Right and Intere≈øt of the Lawful Prince; as appears plainly by the former limitation, <hi>that the Acts of a fal≈øe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtrate are of validity, and his Per≈øon is to be obeyed, <hi>until</hi> he be declared an <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper by ≈øome Higher Power.</hi> And the Ca≈øe of <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> is but an example to illu≈øtrate the Doctrine he had before delivered; and when <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Richmond</hi> had declared <hi>Richard</hi> an U≈øurper, (as he manife≈øtly did by making war upon him) the validity of his Acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Obedience to his Per≈øon fell from him, and centred in the Higher Powers and in the Ordinance of God; and 'tis ridiculous to que≈øtion the lawfulne≈øs of taking Commi≈ø≈øions from the Higher Powers, to fight again≈øt a Prince who hath no Authority, and when there is no obedience due to him. And by this time the Dr. may ≈øee what great Rea≈øon he had to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to his Reader <hi>to judge on which ≈øide Dr.</hi> Jack≈øon <hi>is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the validity of the Acts of Government by an U≈øurper, the Dr. may be ≈øatisfied in the <hi>Ca≈øe of Allegiance to a King</hi> de facto. And that worthy Author hath ≈øince given him abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ≈øatisfaction.</p>
            <p>We have now ≈øeen how much that which <hi>he</hi> hath cited out of Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> makes for him, in the next place let us con≈øider, how much that which I have cited makes again≈øt him, he did not care to repeat it; but thus it is as much as concerns the Ca≈øe of U≈øurpation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He who is a mere <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper, or a Tyrant by Title may be re≈øi≈øted by violence even to depo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or death, albeit he happens to exerci≈øe his power with ≈øuch moderation, as would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ju≈øt and lawful King; ‚Äî it is a truth unque≈øtionable, that a Tyrant by Title,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>may be re≈øi≈øted without re≈øi≈øting the Ordinance of God: And the Rea≈øon is plain, for that he could neither u≈øurp, nor continue his power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe than by re≈øi≈øting ≈øome Higher Powers, or by re≈øi≈øting the Ordinance of God;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others he in≈øtances, <hi>in ca≈øe he u≈øurp or exerci≈øes Royal Authority over ≈øuch as have been formerly governed by Royal Succe≈ø≈øion; he openly re≈øi≈øts power much higher than his own, whether this power be <hi>yet actually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed</hi> to ≈øome known Per≈øons, that have Right or Title to the Kingdom by Succe≈ø≈øion, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in defect of the Antient Royal I≈ø≈øue,</hi> &amp;c. from hence the≈øe things are plain.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That an U≈øurper may ju≈øtly be re≈øi≈øted and depo≈øed, and therefore he hath not the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øi≈øtable Authority of a Sovereign Prince. And the Drs.

            <p n="1">1.

And therefore whatever may be due to an U≈øurper in the exerci≈øe of Royal Power in indifferent ca≈øes, nothing can be due to him in prejudice of the Right Heir, for our duty to the place and power the U≈øurper holds (which is the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> allows) can never be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to the wrong and injury of the Per≈øon, to whom that place and power of Right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, and who≈øe it is: For I hope no duty to U≈øurpers will excu≈øe us for re≈øi≈øting the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> and the <hi>Ordinance of God;</hi> and if the Right Heir be the <hi>Higher Power</hi> and the <hi>Ordinance of God,</hi> then who≈øoever re≈øi≈øts him, re≈øi≈øts the <hi>Higher Power</hi> and the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God:</hi> And I would fain know, if the U≈øurper by re≈øi≈øting the Rightful Prince, re≈øi≈øts the <hi>Higher Power</hi> and the <hi>Ordinance of God,</hi> why al≈øo every man el≈øe that re≈øi≈øts the rightful Prince does not likewi≈øe re≈øi≈øt, the <hi>Higher Power</hi> &amp; the <hi>Ordinance of God.</hi> And the Dr. may trie if he has a di≈øtinction that can make it a duty to obey U≈øurp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And thus Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> him≈øelf expre≈øly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines it in the very ca≈øe of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, He tells us, (3.

               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have one thing more to ob≈øerve from hence, and that is, that the Rightful King out of Po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øion is not only the <hi>Higher Power,</hi> but that he has the Power <hi>actually</hi> annex'd to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, for thus Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> expre≈ø≈øes it, the U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>openly re≈øi≈øts Power much higher than his own, whether the Power be yet <hi>actually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed</hi> to ≈øome known Per≈øons that have Right or Title to the Kingdom by ≈øucce≈ø≈øion;</hi> which overthrows at lea≈øt one half of his two books, and all his Arguments about <hi>actual</hi> Authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And be≈øides fully an≈øwers his little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception about receiving Commi≈ø≈øions from them; for it is ridiculous and a contradiction to talk of Power being <hi>actually</hi> annexed to the Per≈øon of a Prince, when he cannot exerci≈øe any <hi>Acts</hi> of Power and Authority.</p>
            <p>The Dr. comes to examine another citation I produced out of Dr. <hi>Jackson.</hi> And u≈øhers it in with this laudable preface; <hi>But this he has ≈øo ≈øhamefully mangled, that a little di≈øcretion would have taught him rather to have left it out, then to have betrayed ≈øo much di≈øhone≈øty in his quotations.</hi> The≈øe are hard words, and the Dr. is bound in honour to make them good, for it is <hi>≈øhamele≈øs</hi> with a witne≈øs to charge a man at this rate, and have nothing to ≈øay to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtifie it; And let us ≈øee what it is he does ≈øay: He ≈øays, <hi>he will give the Reader the entire pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage.</hi>

In all the proce≈øs of which action nothing was done, either by the High Prie≈øt, or by the re≈øt of the Princes and People of <hi>Judah,</hi> which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf did not require at <hi>their</hi> hands:</q> And what is all this to Jehoiada's <hi>being the Higher Power and Authority to whom the judgment of ≈øuch matters belonged?</hi> where is any judicial or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative Act of his? he conven'd them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and which he might do as High Prie≈øt, and Prince of his Tribe, and acquainted them with the Pre≈øervation of their Prince; and the Convocation attributes no more to him in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; but the acknowledgment of their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, and the bu≈øine≈øs of depo≈øing and ≈ølay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Athaliah</hi> was re≈øolved on by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent; <hi>(by the ≈øaid States)</hi> There is nothing of Authority a≈øcrib'd to <hi>Jehoiada</hi> in this, and they expre≈øs it yet plainer in their <hi>Canon.</hi> 
               <q>Or that <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the High Prie≈øt was not bound, as he was a Prie≈øt both to <hi>inform</hi> the Princes and People, of the Lords promi≈øe, that <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> ≈øhould reign over them, and likewi≈øe to anoint him.</q> Now as I take it <hi>informing</hi> is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them, nor directing them by an act of Authority.

            <p>And now let me ask the Dr. where is the <hi>≈øhameful mangling and di≈øhone≈øty</hi> in my not citing this pa≈ø≈øage of <hi>Jehoiada</hi>'s being a <hi>Prime Peer, and inve≈øted with Power of juri≈ødiction next to the Higher Power?</hi> For what is that to the purpo≈øe for which I cited Dr. <hi>Jackson?</hi> The ≈øingle que≈øtion is, whether it be lawful to obey an U≈øurper in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition to the Right Heir out of po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion; and what was the heigth of his Station, and the power of his Juri≈ødiction to that? as high as he was, it was not <hi>lawful</hi> for him, and his fact plainly declares it. His high dignity indeed made it rea≈øonable for him to interpo≈øe his Authority in behalf of the Right Heir, and was the fitte≈øt to conduct and manage an affair of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but it made no difference in the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the thing; for if it be unlawful for a <hi>Prime Peer</hi> to joyn him≈øelf to an U≈øurper in oppo≈øition to the Rightful Prince, 'tis unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for a <hi>private Subject.</hi> And that was all that I was concerned in; it was foreign to the que≈øtion to meddle in the di≈øpute with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øts, to whom this was an An≈øwer, for they urge this fact of <hi>Jehoiada</hi> as an Act of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity annexed to the Prie≈øthood, And the Dr. ≈øays in expre≈øs terms, That <hi>this was an Act of Authority and Juri≈ødiction.</hi> I will not return his ≈øcurrilous <hi>inuendo</hi> of <hi>looking kindly towards Rome;</hi> but he hath given the Papi≈øt greater advantage in this Controver≈øie than any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant ever did: For if it be granted, that this was <hi>an Act of Juri≈ødiction</hi> and Authority in <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> the Que≈øtion hath a new face, and 'tis ≈øplitting an hair, whether that was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the High Prie≈øt, or of the Prime Peer; whereas all Prote≈øtants have fix'd it upon a clearer bottom, and ≈øay that what he did, was in the Right of his Prince, and not by any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his own; and remove the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øie off of that bottom, and admit that <hi>Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> acted in a way of <hi>Juri≈ødiction,</hi> it will be very difficult to prove, but that the High Prie≈øt, <hi>qua</hi> ≈øo, had the highe≈øt Authority in that State, next to the King; and con≈øequently if <hi>Jehoiada</hi> acted <hi>authoritatively</hi> it was in the capacity of

That the Drs. outcry about the change of one particle for another (<hi>or</hi> for <hi>and</hi>) is a meer Cavil, for if what Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> ≈øays here may interpret his ≈øen≈øe, then the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>and</hi> in that ≈øentence (<hi>≈øave only in his right and interest <hi>and</hi> by his Commi≈ø≈øion and command</hi>) is to be under≈øtood <hi>disjunctively;</hi> for 'tis not to be ≈øuppo≈øed, that ≈øuch an <hi>Infant</hi> Prince could give <hi>Jehoiada</hi> a Commi≈ø≈øion And then a Subject e≈øpecially if he be the Prime Peer, may depo≈øe an U≈øurper in the Right of a di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed Prince, without his <hi>Commi≈ø≈øion,</hi> or, if it may be ≈øuppo≈øed, then <hi>a Subject may lawfully take a Commi≈ø≈øion from a di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed Prince, to fight again≈øt an <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper in the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne;</hi> and the Dr. may take his choice, and ≈øuppo≈øe which he plea≈øes.

               <hi>and ≈øome body or other might chance to remember.</hi> He an≈øwers, <hi>He fears not our Memories ≈øo much as our Inventions, and bids us produce the man.</hi> And yet for all this ≈øwaggering, the matter is not ≈øo very plain, but it needs a Di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to help him off. And thus follows:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tho our Author ≈øeems very well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the thing call'd Faction (i. e.</hi> 'tis a very <hi>factious</hi> thing to write again≈øt the Doctor) <hi>yet he is not willing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand the word; and therefore I mu≈øt tell him, that when I ≈øay, <hi>I was never facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> again≈øt the Oath, I do not mean, that I was never hearty and zealous again≈øt taking the Oath; for I hope there may be Zeal without Faction; or that when I was pre≈ø≈øed to di≈øcour≈øe the matter, I did not talk with as much warmth and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as other men. But Faction is quite another thing, it ≈øhews it ≈øelf in Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Schi≈øms, in Rancour and Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, Envyings and Emulations, in violent oppo≈øitions to Government, in changing and confining friend≈øhip to a Party, in Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures and Reproaches, in ≈øtigmatizing al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> The≈øe were intended for a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Adver≈øary and the Non-≈øwe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rers. For he tells me, <hi>I ≈øeem to be well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the thing (faction),</hi> and ≈øo I am to thank him for all the≈øe fine Characters. Now I have no An≈øwer to hard names, but methinks he might have ≈øpar'd <hi>Schi≈ømaticks,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Po≈øt≈øcr. p. 10.</note> 'till he had an≈øwer'd a ≈ømall Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion I put to him, about that affair.</p>
            <p>Now this is a very plea≈øant bu≈øine≈øs, the Doctor, I ≈øuppo≈øe, would per≈øwade me, to prove him a <hi>Schi≈ømatick, Bitter and Envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, a violent oppo≈øer of Government,</hi> &amp;c. for not taking the Oath. And yet he is ≈øo kind to be≈øtow all the≈øe favors upon us. And I do not know why they might not fit him as well in the ≈øame Capacity. But what he ≈øaid or did, is <hi>Heartine≈øs</hi> or <hi>Zeal,</hi> what we do is <hi>Faction,</hi> and I know not what. Now I will readily grant him, when he ≈øaid <hi>he was never engaged in any Faction again≈øt the Oath,</hi> he did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to call him≈øelf a <hi>Schi≈ømatick, Envious, Cen≈øorious,</hi> and all the hard Names above,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:107829:88"/> but that he did de≈øign likewi≈øe to quit him≈øelf of <hi>Heartine≈øs</hi> and <hi>Zeal,</hi> is evident enough, from the ≈øecond Page of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his <hi>Ca≈øe of Allegiance.</hi> There he tells, <hi>Tho I refu≈øed to take the Oaths, I never engaged in any faction again≈øt it.</hi> And how does he prove that? It follows <hi>I never made it my bu≈øine≈øs to di≈ø≈øwade men from it; when my opinion was asked, I declared my own thoughts; but I never ≈øought out men to make Pro≈øelytes.</hi> What is this to <hi>Schi≈øm,</hi> and <hi>Rancor,</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> and <hi>Emulation,</hi> and all the re≈øt of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So that to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwade men from the Oath, e≈øpecially when not asked, is that which he means by <hi>Faction,</hi> or el≈øe his Paragraph is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con≈øi≈øtent with it ≈øelf. And as to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this kind, I tell him again, <hi>that <hi>never</hi> is a very long time.</hi> And a man that makes ≈øuch a bold a≈ø≈øertion, had need be ≈øure of his own memory, before he charges other mens inventions.

               </gap>der what he means by <hi>Zeal:</hi> it is indeed oppo≈øed to <hi>Faction;</hi> but it is oppo≈øed likewi≈øe to Coldne≈øs and Indifferency. And which is yet more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, he ≈øays in the ≈øame Preface, that <hi>he wi≈øhed he could have done</hi> (taken the Oaths) <hi>as others did.</hi> This is an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in≈øtance of <hi>Zeal,</hi> to be <hi>Zealous</hi> again≈øt what we think an <hi>Ill Thing,</hi> and at the ≈øame time <hi>wi≈øh</hi> we could do it. He ≈øays he thought it an <hi>Ill Thing,</hi> and a few Line, after tells us, he <hi>wi≈øhed he could</hi> take it? This is ≈øuch a Zeal, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was heard of: Does Zeal again≈øt a thing, u≈øe to ≈øhew it ≈øelf in wi≈øhes and de≈øires towards it? This is an Argument of great in≈øincerity, but very little Zeal; ≈øo that whatever the Dr. may ≈øpeak of his Zeal and Warmth to ≈øtop an Objection, which could not otherwi≈øe be avoided, it is plain enough, that he took all care to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent it as little as po≈ø≈øible; and he hath given ≈øuch a cold and languid account of his management, while he was engaged again≈øt the Oath; That any man that is not blind or prejudic'd, may plainly ≈øee, that his wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He adds, <hi>Whereas tho there had been a material perjury, a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent opinion may excu≈øe from formal perjury;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 80.</note> 
               <hi>for no man is formally perjur'd, who does not know it. I ≈øhall not explain this by in≈øtances; for if our Author is for writing <hi>Secret Hi≈øtories,</hi> I am not ≈øo at pre≈øent.</hi> This is dark and my≈øterie, and ≈øo it mu≈øt remain, 'till the Doctor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it.

               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 72.</note> altho there is not the lea≈øt word of it in my Book: and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor knows what con≈øtruction the World has always made;<note place="margin">Lett. p. 32.</note> when men are careful and ≈øolicitous to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate an accu≈øation, which was never made again≈øt them.</p>
            <p>As for his Parting and Conclu≈øion, I have only this to ob≈øerve, That the Doctor hath the <hi>mode≈øte≈øt</hi> way of ending his Books that ever I ≈øaw. His <hi>Vindication of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:107829:88"/> Doctrine of the Trinity,</hi> and his <hi>Doctrine of Self-con≈øciou≈øne≈øs,</hi> he ends thus, <hi>I am pretty confident he will never be able to rea≈øon to any purpo≈øe, in this Cau≈øe again.</hi> Altho he hath given his Adver≈øary the greate≈øt Advantage, and in≈øtead of vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, hath mightily prejudic'd that Article of the Chri≈øtian Faith, by clogging it with <hi>New Notions;</hi> and which in a ≈øettled State of the Church, would hardly have e≈øcap'd Eccle≈øia≈øtical Cen≈øure. His <hi>Ca≈øe of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> concludes, with <hi>hoping he may ≈øatisfie them</hi> (tho≈øe not of his mind) <hi>that he hath <hi>≈øomething</hi> to ≈øay for him≈øelf,</hi> a <hi>Mei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o≈øis,</hi> very great, con≈øiderable, unan≈øwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And he ends his <hi>Vindication,</hi> with telling me, <hi>if I will promi≈øe to examine his Arguments well before I an≈øwer, he ≈øhall expect to hear no more from me.</hi> And yet a man would be apt to imagine, that fal≈øe Rea≈øonings, Artificial Shifts and Di≈øtinctions, plain and downright Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions in the Premi≈øes, were an unequal foundation, to ≈øupport ≈øo much <hi>Triumph</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> in the Conclu≈øion. However the Doctor finds he is mi≈øtaken; he hath <hi>heard from me</hi> again. But whether <hi>I have examin'd his Arguments <hi>well,</hi>
               </hi> I ≈øhall leave to the Reader's Judgment, and to the Doctor's Examination.</p>
