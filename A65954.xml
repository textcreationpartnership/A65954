            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note place="margin">P. 1.</note> 
               <hi>who hath been ſo weak</hi> (by a figure I ſuppoſe) <hi>as to confeſs he is not infallible, ever to believe his own ſenſes again.</hi> Now if the Dr. thinks it decent to <hi>recant</hi> in ruffling language, and to propoſe his new opinions in ſuch a ſtrein of confidence and defiance; he may enjoy his own humour for me, I have once told him my mind about it, and ſhall give him no farther trouble on that account. And, if he likes it, he may go on and repreſent ſome of thoſe men; who not long ſince ſtood upon the ſame bottom with him, and own'd the ſame Principles, only with leſs heat and violence, by all the ſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful characters and inſinuations he can; and at the ſame time tell the world he is not <hi>angry,</hi> and complain of <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>venom, changing and confining friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips to a Party.</hi> But methinks he might have ſpared the Anſwerer for writing with <hi>triumph and aſſurance,</hi> if he had done ſo; except the Dr. can ſhew his <hi>Patent,</hi> that no body may write ſo but himſelf: And I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him, if he can find any thing in my <hi>Anſwer</hi> or <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> comparable to that <hi>Triumphant</hi> concluſion of his <hi>Vindication; If he</hi> (his Anſwerer) <hi>will promiſe to examine them</hi> (his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments) <hi>well before he anſwers, I ſhall expect to hear no more of him.</hi> Now it is a little of the thickeſt for a man to boaſt at this rate, and at the ſame time to charge his Anſwerer with writing <hi>with Triumph and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner he might have ſpared the reflexion that follows, he tel s me, <hi>he ſhall beg leave to follow his own method, and juſtifie what he hath ſaid in the ſame order he hath aid it in;</hi> And then adds, <hi>his</hi> (his Anſwerers) <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of which, has more of art than honeſty in it.</hi> Now if I had miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his Arguments, or perverted the ſenſe of them, or drawn from them any odious or uncharitable inferences, and with <hi>great honeſty</hi> inſinuated that he did not believe a Providence or had <hi>inclinations</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. P. 48. 58.</note> there might have been ſome colour for this reflexion. But if he hath notoriouſly done all theſe himſelf, as will plainly appear in the following diſcourſe, then his own reflexion faſtens upon him, and he had better have let it alone, for his own ſake at leaſt, tho it had been civil e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for his Anſwerer. But ſome men are very free of their <hi>challenges:</hi> But when they are anſwer'd, they are up in the boughs, and out of all bounds; the Drs. Hypotheſis was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, and there is the plain <hi>Diſhoneſty</hi> of the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>But as for his <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> 'tis all one to me, he may take which he likes beſt to <hi>juſtifie</hi> his Doctrines and Argum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But if it were admitted to be true, and not ſuppoſitions: There is a great deal of difference between the judgment of King <hi>James,</hi> as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in that Letter, and the Doctors; King <hi>James</hi> expreſſeth it with words of abatement and caution, <hi>you have ſtumbled upon the threſhold of that opinion, which makes God the Author of ſin, in ſaying upon the matter, that even Tyranny is Gods Authority;</hi> and again you ſay <hi>upon the matter.</hi> But the Doctor ſays it is as ſure as can be, and hopes he may be allow'd to <hi>believe his own ſenſes.</hi> As if King <hi>James</hi> might not have <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>ſenſes</hi> as well as the Doctor: But what King <hi>James</hi> could not, did not charge directly upon the Convocation, the Doctor plainly declares to be the ſenſe of it, and hath made it the foundation, both of his <hi>freedom of thinking,</hi> and of writing a Book. Now ſuppoſe King <hi>James</hi> did conceive the expreſſions of the Convocation had ſuch a tendency,<note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg.

And if not, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how the Convocation went on, and proceeded to paſs the Book in the upper houſe of Convocation, and paſs the other Books in the lower houſe. And likewiſe afterwards to paſs the <hi>Province of York.</hi> This could never have been done, except King <hi>James</hi> had been ſatisfied, that the words of the Convocation had no ſuch tendency as he ſeem'd to apprehend.

            <p>The place is this ch. 28. pag 57, <hi>The Conv.</hi> having given account of the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous revolution of Governments brought about by the Providence of God, who for the ſins of a Natio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He tells us,<note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg. p. 5.</note> 
               <hi>he obſerved in the firſt place from the words of the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That thoſe Princes who have no legal right to their Thrones, may yet have God's Authority, which</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I proved, becauſe the Convocation ſpeaks of illegal and uſurped Powers, and yet affirms, that the Authority exerciſed by them is Gods Authority.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>To this</hi> (ſaith the Doctor) <hi>the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor anſwers, The Doctor will not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Poſtſcript p. 3.</note> 
               <hi>but the Convocation diſtinguiſhes between the means of acquiring the power, and the power it ſelf, the means of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107829:4"/> power, may be very unjuſt and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal, and yet the power afterwards may be very legal. But the Doctor reſolves they muſt be all one, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Convocation ſpeaks of the ambition of encroaching Kings, and the Rebellion of Subjects, as a means whereby Governments have been alter'd, therefore by a Government being throughly ſetled they muſt mean uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed powers, as if it were impoſſible for ſuch beginnings afterwards to acquire a Right, and to terminate in a legal Title; and till that is, the Government is as unjuſt as the Rebellion and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment.</hi> Theſe I own to be my words, and further that the Doctor concludes rightly from them, when he ſays, <hi>that according to this Author, a Government which is illegally and wickedly begun, when it is legally ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led has God's Authority, and this is all that the Convocation meant by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this the Doctor replyes, <hi>As for what he ſays, that I will not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the means of acquiring Power, and the Power it ſelf; I do not indeed diſtinguiſh as he does, but I diſtinguiſh as the Convocation does, that the means are wicked, but the Power and Authority is Gods, which is all the diſtinction the Convocation makes.</hi> Very well, and which I pray are theſe <hi>means</hi> that are wicked that the Convocation ſpeaks of? I know of none but the wicked means of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the power, as by Rebellion, and ambitious encroachments; and what is the <hi>Power and Authority that is God's?</hi> The Convocation mentions no other, but a <hi>Government throughly ſetled,</hi> and if the Convocation diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes between theſe (as it plainly does) then the Convocation diſtinguiſhes as I do, whatever the Doctor diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes; and by reaſon of that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it cannot be concluded from the Convocation, that <hi>becauſe they ſpeak of the Ambition of encroaching Kings and the Rebellion of Subjects, as a means whereby Governments have been alter'd; therefore by a G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tors aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and he hath not yet contradicted it. He tells us (as above) that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd from the words of the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: That thoſe Princes, who have no legal right to their Thrones, may yet have God's Authority: Which (ſaith he) I proved, becauſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation ſpeaks of illegal, and uſurped Powers. But that is the Queſtion, which he begs and takes for granted, which yet is the main thing to be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he did not before, nor hath yet offered to prove it. The Convocation ſpeaks indeed of, and condemns the wicked means of acquiring Power; and the Doctor ſeems from thence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that by a Government through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſetled, they mean uſurped Powers. He ſays here,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 4.</note> 
               <hi>when the Convocation ſpeaks of the ſettlement of illegal Powers, which began by Ambition and Rebellion;</hi> where he manifeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds what the Convocation diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes, and becauſe they ſay they <hi>began</hi> by Ambition and Rebellion, therefore the ſettlement they ſpeak of muſt needs be the ſettlement of illegal Powers; whereas the Convocation ſpeaks not one word of the ſettlement of illegal Powers; they ſpeak indeed of the ſettlement of Powers which began by wicked means: But theſe are two different things, and the Convocation plainly diſtinguiſhes them. And <hi>ſuch beginnings may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards acquire a Right, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in a Legal Title;</hi> and that I think is plainly the meaning of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, and that from this diſtinction, for they expreſly tell us, in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Convoc. p. 57.</note> that <hi>their attempts</hi> (to acquire ſuch Governments) <hi>of all ſorts are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107829:5"/> wicked and deteſtable in the ſight of God;</hi> and if the Government after it is acquir'd be as unju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> of God;</hi> and then it follows, that we can no more become partys to the Government, than to the Rebellion and encroachment; for to ſay that a man may, (and much more is bound to) ſupport, maintain, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bett wickedneſs, is ſuch a Poſition in Divinity, that I never before met with. I know the Doctor hath a fine notion, and talks of God's Authority; but that God's Authority was ever actually join'd with a thing, the very being of which is <hi>wicked and deteſtable in his ſight,</hi> is a notion that a man may ſafely conclude never entred into the heads of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</p>
            <p>This is the reaſon for which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the diſtinction, and I thought I had expreſſed it plainly enough, but the Doctor is only pleaſed to repeat and take no further notice of it; but inſtead of that, deſires me to ſhew him, <hi>where the Convocation ſays, that a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is illegally acquir'd cannot be throughly ſetled, till it becomes le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi> But what need is there for that? It is not the cuſtom of all Perſons (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever learned) to expreſs themſelves in ſuch a peremptory manner as the Dr. does, he tells us indeed, that God <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> make a King except he oblige the People to obey him; but that is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the manner of the learned, who are contented with affirmative expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as more modeſt. But ſaith the Dr. <hi>if this had been their meaning it had been eaſily ſaid, and had prevented all miſtakes about it, which their words without this limitation, are apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray men into,</hi> ſay you ſo, then I doubt a <hi>thorough ſettlement</hi> is not ſo plain a matter as every body can ſee, and the Doctor's believing his own ſenſes is but a banter: But however they might have eaſily ſaid it; and if the Doctor's ſenſe had been their meaning might they not as eaſily have ſaid that? and I wonder which is e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But let us hear his Reaſons.</p>
            <p>For, ſaith he, <hi>If the Convoc. meant no more than our Author ſays that a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment illegally begun, when it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This I think I am to thank the Dr. for; for though he brings it as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the Interpretation I have made of the ſenſe of the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, I take it to be a conſiderable Confirmation of it. For though I do not believe that no body diſputes this nor that the Convocation thought ſo (as we ſhall ſee preſently) yet if it were ſo it makes nothing againſt my Interpretation, but for it. For where is the harm of interpreting the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Convocation according to the general ſenſe of mankind? And if no man who owns the Authority of any Government to be from God, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes that Governments let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin how they will, when they are once legally ſetled, have God's Authority; why does not the Convocation mean ſo too, if their words will bear it, which the Dr. owns;<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 5.</note> and I wonder which is moſt likely to be their ſenſe, that which no body diſputes, or that which every body diſputes, for I hope we may think, without any Reflection upon them, that a <hi>wiſe and grave Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> were not as ready to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Paradoxes</hi> as the Doctor is. And what an admirable Objection is this? <hi>What wonderful Diſcovery is this? who doubts of this?</hi> As if a Convocation ſat for nothing elſe but to make <hi>wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſcoveries;</hi> and if this ſignified any thing it is an Argument againſt half the Book: And all the plain and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Truths they deliver, we muſt not believe to be their ſenſe, and for this weighty reaſon, becauſe <hi>no body d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ected by a Convocation.</hi> This is a terrible Objection, for I hope a <hi>grave and wiſe Convocation</hi> did not ſit to make directions for <hi>Bedlam.</hi> But what now if by all this Rant about <hi>Bedlam</hi> and <hi>Madneſs</hi> the Dr. means only <hi>moral</hi> madneſs (a new ſort of <hi>Madneſs</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with a <hi>moral Incapacity</hi>) which conſiſts in vitious, abſurd, and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Opinions. And then I hope it may not be ſo utterly impoſſible but a wiſe and grave Convocation may take them into conſideration. I confeſs I then did not, nor yet do think them otherwiſe than very foul and unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Opinions; but for all that, I do not think but that Governments may, and actually have been diſturb'd by them, let the Dr. wonder as much as he pleaſe. For there are no Opinions ſo wild, eſpecially in matters of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but what have always had too many Followers. But to let that matter alone, let us inquire into the Opinion, whether there were not then or ſince ſuch Opinions in the world, that plainly centred in this, That Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours were reſiſtable, becauſe they could not derive their Government from <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Noah,</hi> or by Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs nomination; and I ſhall leave it with him, whether ſuch a Notion did or can diſturb any Government. What does he think of the <hi>Original Power of the People</hi> and Government being nothing elſe but <hi>compact.</hi> This is always finally reſolved into this; for when the Advocates of that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are urg'd with the patriarchal Authority, with the Authority of <hi>Noah,</hi> and which was deriv'd to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and with Gods expreſs nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, (which they neither can nor do deny) that in theſe caſes Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did not proceed from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The Anſwer always is, Let them ſhew their deſcent from <hi>Noah,</hi> or Gods expreſs nomination, and then they ſhall be allow'd to have the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.<note place="margin">Their preſent Maj. Gov. proved to be throly ſetled p. 8.</note> And there is an <hi>Author</hi> who hath publiſhed a Book ſince the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's Vindication, and it ſeems de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd in defence of him, who expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it thus, <hi>I ſuppoſe all Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt have their Original either from Submiſſion or from Paternal Authority, becauſe no Prince living can make good his claim as the direct their from</hi> Noah. So that Government being founded in <hi>compact</hi> is always defended by ſuch Reaſonings, and is always ultimately reſolv'd into it; and whether that be a notion fit only for a <hi>Mad mans</hi> head, I muſt leave to the Doctor's own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.</p>
            <p>But to ſeek no farther, the Dr. him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath ſaid enough of all Conſcience in this point; for to clear his own Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis he tells us concerning preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, <hi>That how long ſoever it is,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now let us ſuppoſe there are men, who maintain theſe Arguments and Reaſonings, (and the Dr. knows this is no ſuch wild ſuppoſition;) let us ſuppoſe likewiſe that they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Doctor's Hypotheſis (and without any great venture a man may ſuppoſe that a thouſand to one does not, and it is plain that all thoſe who uſe theſe very arguments for Reſiſtance do not) and then we are come to this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107829:6"/> very point before us, for every one of theſe Arguments are finally reſolved into this, that Princes are not irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible, becauſe they cannot derive their Governments from <hi>Noah</hi> nor pretend to God's expreſs nomination; ſo that the Doctor of all men, hath the leaſt reaſon to <hi>wonder,</hi> who hath taken ſuch mighty pains to diſplay all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Hypotheſes which ſtand pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon this bottom. And in truth theſe very Opinions and Arguments (except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own and the age before us) never ſwarm'd more than in the time that Convocation ſat; and there is abundance of this fine Doctrine in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Brutus,</hi> in a book <hi>de jure Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus in ſubditos,</hi> in <hi>Parſons</hi> on the Succeſſion, and <hi>Buchanan de jure regni,</hi> and ſome of them are collected by Archbiſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> in his <hi>dangerous poſitions,</hi> who was the moſt reverend Preſident of this Convocation. And all theſe were publiſhed not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they far. And therefore it was no ſuch great break as the Doctor ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines to think the Convocation had a direct reſpect to theſe rebellious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which at that time peſter'd the world.</p>
            <p>But the Doctor ſays <hi>whereas the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties occaſioned by the changes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of Government, eſpecially when a rightful Prince is diſpoſſeſs'd, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſetled in the throne, are very great, and worthy of the determination of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to direct mens Conſciences in ſuch caſes.</hi> Well! but ſuppoſe theſe <hi>great and worthy</hi> buſineſſes which the Doctor hath written two books about, the Convocation thought them to be mere <hi>Bedlam</hi> Principles, and which no man in his right mind would ever have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed, muſt they needs determine it becauſe the Doctor thinks it worthy of them? There was ſome reaſon for the other, for <hi>Junius Brutus</hi> &amp;c. were riſe in the world; but the Doctor's <hi>Caſe of Alleg.</hi> and <hi>Vindication</hi> had not then ſeen the light.</p>
            <p>But the truth is, they have determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this point ſufficiently, in the Caſe of <hi>Joaſh</hi> and <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and in this Chapter too, and the Queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us is, Whether the ſenſe that I have given, or the ſenſe which the Doctor hath given, is their Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and I am content as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ſays <hi>to let every one judge which is the moſt probable account.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. His ſecond Reaſon is, <q>When the Convoc. ſpeaks of the ſettlement of illegal powers, which began by Ambition and Rebellion, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly unreaſonable, unleſs it had been expreſs'd, to expound this of a legal Settlement by acquiring a new legal Right. Settlement, I grant, as our Author ſays, is a Term of Law, and uſed by Lawyers of a legal Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, and muſt always in reaſon be underſtood ſo in Law, when the contrary is not expreſſed: but yet a firm and ſtable poſſeſſion without Right, muſt be confeſs'd to be a Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement too, tho not a rightful Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I ſuppoſe our Author will not deny but that the Government was ſetled in fact under the three <hi>Henries,</hi> tho in his ſenſe it was not a legal Settlement.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, the Dr. plainly begs the Queſtion, for ſaith he, <hi>When the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation ſpeaks of the</hi> Settlement <hi>of ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Powers,</hi> and when is that I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?

               </gap>hority, as that they ſpeak of the Settlement of illegal Powers If therefore the Doctor will ſpeak to the purpoſe, let him prove his Principle; let him prove that when the Convocation ſpeaks of a Settlement, they ſpeak of the Settlement of illegal Powers: but it is a wild ſort of proceeding, to take the main point in Controverſie for granted and then to argue from it, as if it had never been diſputed: at this rate a man may make the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-book or any other book ſay what we pleaſe. The Doctor knows that I deny that the Convoc. ſpeaks of the Settlement of illegal Powers, and that on the contrary, Powers, ſo long as they continue illegal, cannot (in the ſenſe of the Convoc.) be ſaid to be ſetled.</p>
            <p>But (ſays the Dr.) it is manifeſtly unreaſonable, unleſs it had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, to expound this of a legal Settlement, and is it nor expreſs'd?

Let the world ſay what they will, the notion that I give of a Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement is that it denotes a rightful
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107829:7"/> and peaceable Poſſeſſion, which every body, and the Dr. himſelf owns to be a Settlement, tho he will not allow it in the preſent caſe, and I cannot blame him, becauſe it overthrows his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis; the Doctor's notion is a Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of Poſſeſſion without Right, nay againſt it; nay further againſt a viſible and undeniable Right actually proſecuted, tho he cannot (and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer put it to him to) ſhew that any Author ever gave ſuch an account of a Settlement, either with reſpect to any uſurped Poſſeſſion, or with reſpect to the particular caſe of Uſurped Powers. And I ſhall leave it with the Reader, which is the moſt <hi>foreign and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſenſe,</hi> and conſequently (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him) which <hi>argues the greateſt perverſneſs of mind;</hi> to interpret it in the uſual, vulgar, and univerſally receiv'd acceptation, or to coyne a new ſenſe of it to fit a preſent turn, and in which it was never underſtood before.</p>
            <p>The Dr. tells us, to confirm his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That <hi>it is plain that the right and ſettlement of government are two very different things, for they may be parted; the firſt relates to the Title, the ſecond to the ſetled Poſſeſſion, and exerciſe of government. And whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Rightful King is diſpoſſeſſed, our Author muſt grant, that his ſettlement is gone, tho not his Right;</hi> well, if I muſt grant it I muſt, and what then? Then ſaith the Dr. <hi>if Right and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be parted, I deſire to know, why there may not be a Settlement without Right, and then it is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to conclude, that Settlement muſt always ſignifie Right;</hi> and, I wonder, whoever ſaid that Settlement either <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways</hi> or at all <hi>ſignify'd</hi> Right; it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a Rightful and quiet poſſeſſion, and that is neither Right ſingly, nor Poſſeſſion ſingly, but both together, joyn'd with quiet from other pretences, and this is an anſwer to what the Dr. deſires to know, <hi>why if Right and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement may be parted, there may nor be a Settlement without Right,</hi> becauſe Settlement always includes and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Right, but on the contrary Right does not include nor ſuppoſe a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But this is nothing but fallacy, and by this way of reaſoning, a Man may prove any compounded thing to be without the neceſſary parts of its compoſition. A Houſe conſiſts of Walls and other things, but if the Dr. undertakes the buſineſs, he can prove a houſe to be without Walls; for it is plain, that a Wall and a Houſe may be parted, and if a Houſe and a Wall may be parted, then why may not a Houſe be without a Wall; but let us try it in his own Conceſſions, the page before he grants, that in the <hi>Lawyers ſenſe,</hi> Settlement ſignifies a Legal Settlement; now it is plain (in that ſenſe) that <hi>Right and Settlement may be parted;</hi> And <hi>whenever a Rightful Poſſeſſor is diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd, the Doctor muſt grant that his Settlement is gone, tho not his Right, and if (in the Lawyers ſenſe) Right and Settlement may be parted, then</hi> (in that ſenſe) <hi>Settlement may be without Right:</hi> Which, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is contrary to what the Doctor himſelf acknowledges. But all this is trifling and fallacious arguing, <hi>à Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſis ad compoſit a,</hi> becauſe the part may be without the whole, therefore the whole may be without the part, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the whole includes all the parts, therefore every part includes the whole. And how <hi>ridiculous</hi> ſoever it may be to conclude, that ſettlement ſignifies Right, it is not <hi>ridiculous</hi> to conclude, that the Dr. pays us with Sophiſtry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Arguments.</p>
            <p>The Doctor goes on; <hi>Nay the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of</hi> thorough <hi>plainly refers Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement to Poſſeſſion, and not to Right, for there are no degrees of Right, no more than there are of Truth.</hi> Now whatever another man might have ſaid, the Dr. cannot fairly ſay this, without
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107829:8"/> contradicting himſelf: For he tells us over and over, that two Perſons may have a Right to the ſame thing, the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper hath a <hi>Divine</hi> Right, the diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed King a <hi>Legal</hi> Right to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And it is plain that theſe are not the ſame, nor equal Rights, and therefore (according to the Doctor there are degrees of Right, and degrees of Right to Government too. The Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hath a thorough Right for all the People are his Subjects, and the other hath a Right to catch it, if he can get it. This laſt, I muſt confeſs is a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty kind of Right, and ſuch as no body ever heard of before, like the Doctor's notion of a Settlement: But it does not concern me to anſwer that, let the Dr. make it out as well as he can. In the mean time, ſuppoſe there are no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Right; are there no degrees of quiet and peace, may not a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be more or leſs interrupted in the Poſſeſſion? and are there no degrees of Evidence? may not the Right to a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be more or leſs apparent? and this is the import of <hi>throughly,</hi>

               <hi>when ſuch a Right is injoy'd plainly, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently without any contradiction or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;</hi> as I had plainly ſaid before, tho the Doctor takes no notice of it.</p>
            <p>As for what the Doctor ſays, <hi>I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Author will not deny,</hi> but that the Government was ſetled in fact un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the three <hi>Henries,</hi> tho in his ſenſe it was <hi>not a Legal Settlement.</hi> If the Doctor will believe the Author of the <hi>unreaſonableneſs of the new Separation.</hi> He ſays, that the Title to the Crown, with reſpect to the two Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> was diſputable, and the Doctor knows there is a wide difference with reſpect to the Poſſeſſion, when the Title is doubtful; and when the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Right and Title is ſo far from being diſputed, that it is evidently acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. But whether the Doctor will believe that Author or no: This I have to ſay, that whatever Settlement there was in the Reigns of the three <hi>Henries</hi> it was <hi>ſub ratione juris</hi> upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Right. <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. claimed the Crown upon pretence of a Legal Right, and he was admitted on that pretence; and there is a great difference, between ſuppoſing a Legal Title, and upon that ſuppoſition owning and ſubmitting to it; and when there is not the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, nay when the Legal Title (as in the Doctor's Hypotheſis is plainly own'd not to be in the poſſeſſor. After <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> 4. had reigned nine years, and was then forced to fly out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. was again poſſeſs'd of the Throne: His Poſſeſſion tho own'd by a Parliament was not a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and for this reaſon, becauſe there was a viſible and apparent Right in <hi>Edward</hi> 4. againſt him and that Right actually proſecuted; and it is plain the Nation thought ſo, when the very acts of Parliament made in the time of that Poſſeſſion, were declared void <hi>ab initio</hi> and ras'd out of the Records. But indeed according to the Doctor's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. had God's Authority, and <hi>Edward</hi> had loſt it; and moreover that the Parliament that depos'd <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. in behalf of the Right Heir, ſet up a Humane againſt a Divine Right, and were every jot a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is ſufficient that <hi>Preſcription</hi> makes a Legal Title: And that it does ſo we have the concurrent judgment of all Ages and all Laws, and to deny it is to affront the univerſal ſenſe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of mankind.

He ſays indeed, <hi>That a Settlement by Preſcription, he does not well underſtand,</hi> and what is that to me or to the Queſtion? all men elſe underſtand it, and it is declared by all Laws, and that is enough for any man to acquieſce in it, tho the Doctor does not underſtand it, or tho he may ſpin Cobwebs, and by art and ſubtlety en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle the plaineſt things.

He is a bold man, that will oppoſe his ſingle judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the World, and ſay that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription does not make a Title, when all Laws ſay it does.</p>
            <p>And this likewiſe is a conſiderable reaſon for my interpretation of a <hi>tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Settlement,</hi> and againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors: For it is certainly very reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to expound the Convocation, in a ſenſe that concurs with the general judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mankind about Government; <hi>it is</hi> (as the Doctor allows) agreed by all men, that a Government by what ill means ſoever attain'd, upon the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Right is a lawful Government, and ought to be obeyed. But for Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation that hath no Right, nay actually oppoſes Right; thoſe that have aſſerted obedience was due to ſuch a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have been ſo very few in any age, and ſo inconſiderable, that the Dr. (tho provoked to it) either cannot, or elſe is aſham'd to name them: So that if a <hi>thorough Settlement</hi> might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in the Doctors ſenſe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107829:9"/> Right, yet if it might mean alſo a Settlement by the acquiſition of Right, it is plainly more reaſonable to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret that to be the ſenſe of the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; for what reaſon is there to put a ſingular ſenſe upon their words, if they will bear a received one? what reaſon is there to make them deliver a new doctrine contrary to the ſenſe of mankind, when their words may be fairly reconcil'd to a Doctrine generally receiv'd, and about which there is no controverſie: But let us hear the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's Arguments againſt it He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,<note place="margin">P. 7.</note> 1. <hi>That all the Convocation ſays relates to the viſible and actual altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Governments and Governors, and tranſlation of Kingdoms brought about by the wickedneſs of men by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Now</hi> (ſays he) <hi>this is matter of fact not of Right;</hi> and his reaſon is, <hi>unleſs all alterations of Government are Rightful and Legal.</hi> Now this indeed would be ſomething if the Convocation had required us to pay obedience <hi>to all</hi> alterations of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But they do it with this limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>when ſuch alterations are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſetled,</hi> and if they had thought <hi>all</hi> alterations of Government were to be obey'd, it had been impertinent to add when they are <hi>throughly ſetled;</hi> and I wonder, from whence he draws this Concluſion: <hi>And therefore the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch alterations is an actual not legal Settlement of them;</hi> for ſuppoſe the alterations are matter of fact, and not of Right, does it follow therefore that the Settlement of theſe alterations, are matter of fact and not of Right too. Alterations and the Settlement of them are two very different things; for by Settlement their very nature is alter'd, and they receive a new Character, and there is Duty and Allegiance belonging to them, when there was none before. And it is abſurd and inconſequent to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from the nature of the Alterations, to the nature of the Settlement, which puts them into a new State, and cloaths them with Authority, and gives them a Right to Homage and Subjection; now a <hi>thorough Settlement</hi> either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the nature of ſuch alte ations, or it does not, if not, then how comes Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to be a duty, to alterations throughly ſetled, and not to theſe which are not ſo; if it does alter their nature and property, then how comes an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the nature of ſuch alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, to affect the notion of the tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Settlement of them? The Dr. adds, <hi>This brings the diſpute to matter of ſenſe</hi> (His eyes I ſuppoſe) <hi>for if ſuch alterations of Government, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of Kingdoms may be made and ſetled without the Death, Ceſſion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and Preſcription, then they are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Settlement the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſpeaks of.</hi> I ſuppoſe that which follows he intends for a Reaſon; <hi>for there may be an actual and viſible Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement without it, which is all that is required to an actual and viſible tranſlation of Kingdoms: And that is all the Convocation intended;</hi> That is to ſay, you muſt believe the Doctor whether he gives any reaſon or no: For how does he prove, that there may be an actual and viſible Settlement with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Right, or that Kingdoms may be tranſlated without it? I grant that the Settlement that tranſlates Kingdoms, is actual and viſible, and ſo it muſt be if it be a Settlement, but if the Doctor will give other People leave to believe their eyes as well as he. His Settlement is neither <hi>Actual</hi> nor <hi>Viſible,</hi> for it is no Settlement at all. But for all that the Doctor adds, <hi>he who will venture to ſay that a new Prince can't be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and viſibly ſetled in the Throne, while the old Rightful King is living and makes his claim, ſhall diſpute by himſelf for me;</hi> now this is the whole diſpute, and 'tis juſt as if he had ſaid, if you will not grant what I magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially affirm, I will diſpute no longer:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107829:9"/> A moſt admirable and grave Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Doctor ſays, <hi>The Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion expreſly teaches, that the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which is God's Authority, and muſt be reverenced and obeyed, when ſuch alterations are throughly ſetled is the Authority</hi> which is unjuſtly gotten or wrung by force from the true and lawful Poſſeſſor; Well the Convocation plainly ſays ſo, and what then? <hi>then</hi> (ſays he) <hi>it is plain it is not a Legal Authority by the Death or Ceſſion of the Rightful King; for we are to obey it as God's Authority, tho it be wrung by force from the true and lawful Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor;</hi> well ſo far is right, but he adds, <hi>and tho the preſent Poſſeſſor ſhould have no other viſible Title to it, but ſuch unjuſt force:</hi> But where had the Doctor theſe laſt words? They are fit enough for his purpoſe, but the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation hath not a word of it, nor any thing like it. They ſpeak indeed of Authority gotten and wrung <hi>by force,</hi> but do they ſay that that is any reaſon why it ought to be obey'd and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renc'd? nothing like it; but only when alterations are <hi>throughly ſetled,</hi> and is it poſſible to believe, that by throughly ſetled they mean nothing but <hi>force?</hi> The Doctor himſelf does not think ſo; for he ſays, the <hi>conſent of the People</hi> makes a Settlement, and that is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than <hi>force,</hi> and therefore according to him, there muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe <hi>viſible</hi> beſides <hi>force,</hi> before it is a duty to obey ſuch alterations. And then it follows, <hi>That the preſent Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor muſt have ſome other viſible Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle beſides ſuch unjuſt force.</hi> But the Doctor referrs us to the words of the Convocation: <hi>The Authority either ſo unjuſtly gotten or wrung by force from the true and lawful Poſſeſſor being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways God's Authority (and therefore receiving no impeachment by the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of thoſe that have it) is ever (when any ſuch alterations are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſetled) to be reverenc'd and obeyed, &amp;c. Now</hi> (ſays the Doctor very trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly) <hi>let any man who underſtands Grammar conſtrue this otherwiſe if he can.</hi> Now I will renounce my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in <hi>Grammar,</hi> if I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue it otherwiſe than he does, and not only ſo, but plainly ſhew, that his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is both falſe, and alſo <hi>ungram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical.</hi> He ſays, <hi>what Authority is that which muſt be obeyed and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced? it is (ſaith the Convocation)</hi> the Authority unjuſtly gotten, or wrung by force, from the true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Poſſeſſor. Very well, ſo far we are agreed, he adds, <hi>And therefore not a new Legal Authority gained by Death, Ceſſion, or a long Preſcription:</hi> And does the Doctor call this Grammatical Conſtruction? This is the only thing in controverſie, and he draws it from the words by inference, or conſequence, and are inferences and conſequences Grammatical Conſtructions? And what does he mean by this inference? <hi>And therefore not a new Legal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> what then? might it not be the old Legal Authority gain'd by a new Right to it; and why I wonder, might not the Right as well as the Authority be gained from the Poſſeſſor? But the Grammatical Conſtruction is directly againſt him; what Authority is that which muſt be obey'd and reverenc'd? it is (ſays the Convocation) <hi>the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity unjuſtly gotten or wrung by force from the true and lawful Poſſeſſor.</hi> And what Authority is that which is wrung from the true and lawful Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor? it is the Legal Authority; for that is what the true and lawful Poſſeſſor was poſſeſs'd of, and which only could be wrung from him. The Doctor inferrs, <hi>and therefore not a new Legal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and much more ſure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not <hi>a new illegal Authority.</hi> The Doctor proceeds, <hi>What is God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which we muſt obey? it is no other than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107829:10"/> or wrung by force, &amp;c. which can receive no impeachment by the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe who have it.</hi> Thus far we are right again, he adds, <hi>By what</hi> wickedneſs? <hi>Their wicked and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and violent means of getting, and having it for the Convocation, ſpeaks of no other wickedneſs but the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation.</hi> And here we are got to inference again, and the only thing in controverſie is drawn from the words, and that unjuſtly. But let us ſee his Grammar; and I would gladly know, where the Doctor places the ſtreſs of this Conſtruction? whether upon the <hi>means</hi> of getting it, or upon the <hi>having</hi> it, if upon the wicked <hi>means</hi> his Conſtruction is true, tho not Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical: But that is not to his purpoſe, and no body diſputes the violent and wicked <hi>means</hi> of getting it, and the Authority after it is got, may be legal enough for all that. But if upon the <hi>having</hi> it (which is the only thing in controverſie) his Conſtruction is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Grammatical, nor true; not Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, for he conſtrues a <hi>Subſtantive</hi> by an <hi>Adjective</hi> or <hi>Adverb,</hi> and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſes the words; and I wonder by what Rules of Grammar: <hi>The wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe that have it,</hi> is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued <hi>their wicked and ungodly having it.</hi> He may call it Paraphraſe, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but he can never ſay it is Grammatical Conſtruction: And as it is not Grammatical, ſo alſo it is not true, for it is not the ſenſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, for they ſay nothing of the <hi>wicked having it,</hi> but of the wicked <hi>means</hi> of <hi>getting</hi> it they do, as more than once in this Chapter, and expreſly <hi>their wicked attempts deteſtable in the ſight of God.</hi> And therefore I ask, as the Doctor does, <hi>By what wickedneſs? the wickedneſs of their attempts</hi> to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in the Government by Rebellion and Encroachment; for this is all the <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs</hi> the Convocation ſpeaks of, and not the wickedneſs of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation</hi> as the Doctor is reſolv'd to have it, tho the Convocation hath not one ſingle word of it. And if the Doctor had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly repeated this paſſage it would plainly have appear'd; and (to uſe ſome of his own language) <hi>he hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly cited it, but not ſo honeſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated it.</hi> He repeats it only <hi>The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority unjuſtly gotten or wrung,</hi> &amp;c. But the Convocation ſays, the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>ſo</hi> unjuſtly gotten or wrung, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what does <hi>ſo</hi> refer to, but the wicke means and <hi>attempts</hi> to gain the Government they had mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? And this plainly ſhews what the Convocation meant by the <hi>wickedneſs of thoſe that have it which is no impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to God's Authority,</hi> and that is not (as the Doctor fanſies) their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>having</hi> it, but their <hi>ſo</hi> unjuſtly <hi>getting</hi> it; and their <hi>ſo</hi> unjuſtly getting it, is their wicked <hi>attempts</hi> to obtain it. But <hi>ſo</hi> is but a ſmall word, and might eaſily be overlooked, and eſpecially when it ſpoils both the Doctors Grammar and his Argument. I hope he will hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter forgive me a ſlip of a Particle, about which he ſo unmercifully treats me, and that without reaſon or juſtice, as we ſhall ſee hereafter. In the mean time the Doctor's <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Logick</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether affords us theſe admirable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God's Authority and a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, are actually annex'd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual wickedneſs and unrighteouſneſs: For the ſtreſs of the Doctors Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction lyes in their <hi>wicked having</hi> it, i. e. their <hi>very being</hi> in Power is wicked, their <hi>very having</hi> it is wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly; and that is, their wickedneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and unrighteouſneſs is God's Authority.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That a man Poſſeſſes a thing <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly</hi> which God gives him, and which is not all, but that he would poſſeſs the very ſame thing <hi>juſtly,</hi> if men gave it him; if upon <hi>the Death, or Ceſſion of the Right Heir,</hi> &amp;c A Prince acquires a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107829:10"/> Right, he then certainly <hi>legally</hi> and <hi>juſtly</hi> poſſeſſes the Throne; But if God only gives it him, then he <hi>hath it wickedly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That men are bound in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſupport and maintain a wicked and unjuſt Poſſeſſor, ev'n in his wicked and unjuſt Poſſeſſion; and which is yet more, ev'n to the manifeſt wrong, and in direct oppoſition to the Right owner.</p>
            <p>Theſe are Doctrines ſuited well enough to the Doctor's <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> But it is no great Credit to any Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they cannot be maintain'd, but by diſhonouring God, and breaking up the foundations of all Righteouſneſs and Juſtice in the world.</p>
            <p>The Doctor tell us, <hi>He proceeded</hi> (in the Caſe of Allegiance) <hi>to prove the ſame thing from other Teſtimonies of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation Book:</hi> and of the Two firſt that he mention'd he ſays, I thought fit to <hi>take no notice of.</hi> And it is true I did not; and the Doctor has Reaſon to thank me for it.<note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg. p. 6. Vindic. p. 9 Convoc. p. 46.</note> They are theſe they teach, <hi>that the Lord (in advancing Kings to their Thrones) is not bound to thoſe Laws which he preſcribeth others to obſerve. And therefore commanded</hi> Jehu <hi>a Subject, to be anointed King over</hi> Iſrael, <hi>of purpoſe to puniſh the Sins of</hi> Ahab <hi>and</hi> Jezebel. But the Doctor ſeeing that this was by Gods expreſs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and therefore nothing at all to his purpoſe, he adds, <hi>And what he did by Prophets in</hi> Iſrael, by <hi>an expreſs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Perſon, he does by his Providence in other Kingdoms, ſet up Kings when he ſees fit, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Right of Succeſſion or Legal Titles.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Convoc. p. 53.</note> 
               <hi>For as they tell us elſewhere, The Lord both may and is able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw any Kings or Emperors, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any Claim, Right, Title or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, which they can challenge, to their Countreys, Kingdoms or Empires.</hi> And can the Doctor ſay, that by theſe words the Convocation means, God's making Kings by Providence? or that they make any ſuch inference from them, that a Perſon poſſeſſed of the Throne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Right, and contrary to it, is made a King by God, and ought to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? If the Doctor can ſay this, I have done wondring at any interpretations he makes either of the Convocation Book, or of the Scripture in favour of his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis. For the Convocation in this very place does not only not refer to God's making Kings by Providence, but is as expreſs againſt the Doctor, as any thing can be. For the Convocation, ſpeaking of, and juſtifying the facts of <hi>Jehu</hi> and <hi>Ahud</hi> in killing King <hi>Joram</hi> and <hi>Eglon,</hi> as having an expreſs warrant from God, and being made Kings by God's expreſs nomination, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately add, <q>Both which examples (being but in number two throughout the Hiſtories of all the Princes, Judges, and Kings either of <hi>Judah</hi> or <hi>Iſrael</hi>) do make it known to us,</q> 
               <hi>that altho the Lord may, and is able to overthrow any Kings or Emperors, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any Claim, Right, Title or Intereſt, which they can challenge to their Countreys, Kingdoms, or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires;</hi> 
               <q>yet foreſeeing in his Heavenly Wiſdom and Divine Providence, what miſchief private men, under colour of theſe Examples, might otherwiſe have pretended, or attempted againſt their Sovereigns (as being either diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented of themſelves, or ſet into fury by other malitious perſons) he did ſo order and diſpoſe of all things in the Execution of theſe ſuch his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Judgments, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may plainly appear to any (that ſhould not wilfully hoodwink him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) never to be lawful for any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whatſoever, upon the pretence of any Revelation, Inſpiration, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment from his Divine Majeſty, either to touch the Perſon of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, or to bear Arms againſt him, except God ſhould firſt advance the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107829:11"/> ſaid perſon from his private Eſtate, and make him a King or an Abſolute Prince to ſucceed his late Maſter, In his Kingdom or Principality.</q> And what they thought of ſuch advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with reſpect to other times, is evident in the Canon to this Chapter; where they ſay with reſpect to the ſame matter; <q>Except <hi>(which is impoſſible)</hi> he ſhould firſt prove his credit, in ſo affirming to be equal with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and that men were bound as ſtrictly to believe him in ſaying, that God called and ſtirred him up to the perpetrating that fact, as we are bound to believe the Holy Ghoſt (by whoſe inſtinct the Scriptures were written) when he telleth us, that God raiſed up <hi>Ahud</hi> for a Saviour to his people.</q> And more to the ſame purpoſe,<note place="margin">Convoc. p. 48.</note> 
               <q>If any man ſhall affirm, that it is lawful for any Captain or Subject, high or low whoſoever, to bear Arms againſt their Sovereign, or to lay violent hands upon his Sacred Perſon, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Jehu</hi> (nothſtanding that any Prophet or Prieſt ſhould incite them thereunto, by Unction or any other means whatſoever, except firſt that it might plainly appear, that there are now any ſuch Prophets ſent extraordinarily from God himſelf, with ſufficient and ſpecial authority in that behalf; and that every ſuch Captain and Subject, ſo incited, might be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that God himſelf had in <hi>expreſs words</hi> and <hi>by name,</hi> required and commanded him ſo to do) he doth greatly err.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From whence theſe Two things are obvious.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That theſe words, <hi>The Lord both may, and is able to overthrow Kings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>notwithſtanding any Right,</hi> &amp;c. plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refer to the facts of <hi>Ahud</hi> and <hi>Jehu,</hi> and have an immediate reſpect to God's ſetting up Kings by his <hi>expreſs nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and in the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> alſo, and therefore very improperly alledged to prove, that what <hi>God did by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in</hi> Iſrael <hi>by expreſs nomination, he does by his Providence in other Kingdoms.</hi> For that that is the ſenſe of the Convocation, the Doctor proves, for <hi>that they tell us elſewhere, that the Lord may and is able,</hi> &amp;c. And yet this very <hi>elſewhere,</hi> has the ſame refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the other, and reſpects the <hi>Kingdom of Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>God's expreſs nomination.</hi> And where is the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? God by expreſs nomination made <hi>Jehu</hi> and <hi>Ahud</hi> Princes, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized them to kill the Kings, whoſe Subjects they were before; and he may do ſo again if he pleaſe: therefore if any perſon, can by Providence get the poſſeſſion of another Princes Throne, he is a King of God's making, as much as <hi>Jehu</hi> or <hi>Ahud;</hi> and has as good autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to act as they had.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They limit and confine the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice upon this Doctrine, to God's expreſs Nomination. They do not mention them, either to allow or eſtabliſh a general practice upon them, but to prevent it. And it ſeems as if they deſigned to prevent that very Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the Doctor draws from them: The Doctor infers, That therefore, whoever is poſſeſs'd of Power by Providence, hath God's Authority: And they infer the clean contrary, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſpecial and expreſs Warrant from him is neceſſary; and granting that <hi>the Lord may and is able to overthrow Kings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>notwithſtanding,</hi> &amp;c. yet no man had any Authority from him, except he was <hi>expreſly</hi> and <hi>by name</hi> appointed by him: And the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo far from ſubſtituting Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the place of Gods nomination, that in the very Caſe upon the account of which they mention theſe words, they ſay, there can be no Authority without God's expreſs warrant, and that ſuch a warrant is now <hi>impoſſible.</hi> So that the Doctor's Interpretation and Inference is directly contrary to that of the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107829:12"/> And by this time I ſuppoſe the Doctor may be ſatisfied there was no ſuch need to call for an Anſwer, and to tell me, <hi>I did not think ſit to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of theſe Paſſages.</hi> And I do <hi>think fit</hi> yet further to <hi>take notice,</hi> that he hath plainly alter'd the ſtate of the matter with reſpect to theſe paſſages: In his <hi>Caſe of Allegiance</hi> he produc'd this paſſage to prove,<note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg. p 6.</note> 
               <hi>That what God did by his Prophets in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs nomination of the Perſon, he does by his Providence in other Kingdoms, ſet up Kings as he ſees fit, without any regard to the Right of Succeſſion, or Legal Titles.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 9.</note> But now in his <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> we have another account: <hi>For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>if they do not prove God's Sovereign Authority, to remove and pull down, the moſt Rightful Kings, and give his Authority to thoſe who have no Right, and place them in the Throne, of thoſe that have the Right, there is no ſenſe to be made of them.</hi> And what is this to <hi>Providence,</hi> which is the main thing in controverſie, and for the proof of which, the Doctor cited thoſe paſſages? Suppoſe they do prove God's Sovereign Authority, to remove and pull down the moſt Rightful Kings, and give his Authority to thoſe who have no Right; Do they prove like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that a Providential poſſeſſion of the Throne, is God's giving his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? or that which he did by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he does by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in other Countries? God's So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Authority is no Queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us; The Convocation allows the Doctrine; but ſays withal, that no man (in thoſe caſes) can act upon it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God's <hi>expreſs</hi> warrant.</p>
            <p>The Doctor expreſſes this oddly, <hi>And give his Authority to thoſe who have no Right, and place them in the Thrones of thoſe that have the Right.</hi> If this is to be underſtood Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and which is the Doctor's Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, That when God has given Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Government to a Perſon, he hath no Right to it; and when he hath taken them away, That Perſon hath ſtill the Right; This is neither the Senſe of the Convocation, nor yet Senſe. For the Convocation ſays, God may overthrow Kings, <hi>notwithſtanding</hi> any Right they can challenge; which inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates not the continuing, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining their Right; as <hi>Jeram</hi> after God had given his Kingdom to <hi>Jehu,</hi> had no longer Right to it; but was (as the Convocation ſays) <hi>Jehu</hi>'s Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and there is nothing more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, than to ſay, that a man hath no Right to what God gives him; and that he hath yet a Right remaining to what God takes away from him.</p>

               <hi>Our Author's Hypotheſis is as direct a contradiction to this, as words can make it: for if no Prince can have God's Authority, nor muſt be obeyed, unleſs he have a Legal Right; either an old Hereditary Right, or a new acquired Right, by the Death or Ceſſion,</hi> &amp;c. What hard ſhifts we are put to to obſcure what will not admit of a plain anſwer? What is this to the purpoſe the Doctor cited thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, or to the Queſtion before us? And where, I pray, did I ever ſay, that no Prince <hi>can</hi> have God's Authority, without ſuch Rights? No doubt he may have it, if God gives it him. And that is the only Queſtion: <hi>Jehu</hi> had God's Authority without theſe Rights; But then God expreſly and by name, gave it to him. Let the Doctor prove, that poſſeſſion of the Throne by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, is equivalent to an expreſs No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; or that it is a ſufficient Evidence, that God hath given ſuch a Poſſeſſor his Authority; and till then, all his Arguments from God s Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Authority ſignifie nothing. To argue from Gods power of diſpoſing Kingdoms, without Legal Right, to his actual diſpoſing them ſo; and becauſe he can give his Authority to one who
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107829:13"/> hath no Right; therefore he that is poſſeſs'd of the Throne without Right, has that Authority, is neither Logick nor Senſe.

But I tell him I learnt that Doctrine, neither from the Convocation, nor from any body but himſelf. But the Doctor is ſo warm in this wild Rant, that he utterly forgets, that what he ſays, is equally againſt his own Notion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation: <hi>The conſent of the people,</hi> is that which (according to him) ſettles a Government, and makes it a duty to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, and without ſuch a conſent 'tis no duty. And <hi>cannot God ſet up Kings, without conſent of the People? then he cannot make a King: for a King without Subjects is no King: He may ſet a man upon the Throne, but cannot make him a King, without leave of the people.</hi> And ſo the Doctor may take his Rebuke again, <hi>wherever he learnt this Doctrine, I am ſure the Convocation never taught it him.</hi> For they have taught over and over, that the people of all ſorts, have no intereſt in, nor any thing to do with the Government: and it ſhould ſeem, that one main end of their Book, was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, and ſhew the falſity of ſuch Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, into which, notwithſtanding the Doctor's fine Principle of the <hi>Conſent of the People</hi> is finally reſolv'd.</p>
            <p>But ſuch Arguments as theſe, will prove any thing in the world: the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> may prove all their fabulous <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends;</hi> God may and is able to work Miracles now, as he did by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and therefore St. <hi>Rumbald,</hi> and a great many other of their Saints, did all thoſe wonderful things they aſcribe to them. And the Doctor knows, ſuch things have been urged, to juſtifie very ill things, (and by men who have own'd the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as he does) God may now give the Land to his People, as he did of old <hi>Canaan</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> and therefore they may cut off the <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi> as a Company of curſed <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites,</hi> to poſſeſs their Eſtates. God may now give the ſame liberty he did to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to ſpoil the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> and therefore whatever we can get from the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Church of <hi>England,</hi> is our own. I do not ſay the Doctor concludes ſo, but his Arguments do: and every one of theſe Conſequences, are as good as the Doctors. And if <hi>Providence</hi> comes in the place of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,</hi> and what God did of old by his <hi>Prophets,</hi> he does now by his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> and Providential Events convey the ſame Right and Authority, as God's own immediate and expreſs direction; then this is very good arguing; and the Doctor's Principles will juſtifie ſuch Practices, tho He does not.</p>
            <p>But yet further, to ſhew the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of the Doctor's Inference, and that from God's altering Stated and Legal Rules in the Caſe of <hi>Jehu,</hi> and by <hi>expreſs nomination,</hi> nothing can be concluded in favour of a Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107829:13"/> Poſſeſſion againſt legal Right; here are theſe two things to be obſerv'd.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That when God ſet up <hi>Jehu</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another Right and Title (and the Caſe is the ſame of any other ſo ſet up by God) there was a clear and evident Revelation of God's Will that he had made him King, and given him his Authority, and about which there could be no doubt or ſcruple. And ſuch a clear Revelation ſeems neceſſary in all ſuch caſes. For when men are under ſacred Tyes and Obligations, from which they cannot otherwiſe be releaſed but by God himſelf (for <hi>tho God is not tied to thoſe Rules he preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth to others,</hi> yet men are tied to thoſe Rules, the obligation of which holds them till they are diſcharged by God who is not tied himſelf, and can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe them that are;) it ſeems neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that the Evidence of Gods Will in diſcharging them, ſhould be as clear and <hi>certain,</hi> as the Evidence they have that the obſerving theſe Rules is their duty; otherwiſe men depart from a <hi>certain</hi> duty, upon the account of an <hi>uncertain</hi> diſcharge from God, and may eaſily find ways to evade their neceſſary duties, eſpecially if they are clogged with difficulty, and ſecular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage. And accordingly when God ſet up <hi>Jehu,</hi> the manifeſtation of God's will was plain and evident, and the perſons concern'd to know it, could make no doubt of it, being reveal'd by Prophets, the ordinary and accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed way of God's making his will known to them. But for Providence, eſpecially in oppoſition to Law and legal Right, being the manifeſtation of God's will in order to practice, I think I may appeal to all the world, whether any man can be as certain, that Poſſeſſion of the Throne by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is as evident an indication of God's will that God hath given his Authority and the Government to him, as he is of the obligation of an Oath, and of the Duty of Alleg. to a rightful King; if not, then he relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes himſelf from an evident Duty by a diſcharge from God leſs evident; <hi>i. e.</hi> he has leſs evidence of his diſcharge than he has of his duty, and that in the ballance of Conſcience is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge at all. Now it needs not be proved, that Providence is not ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a Declaration of God's Will as expreſs Nomination; the Doctor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf owns that in all other Caſes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is not <hi>ſuch</hi> a ſignification of God's Will. And that this Doctrine could never be eſpied before, nay that it was publickly and profeſſedly diſown'd, are no great ſigns of its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And therefore there is a wide difference in the two Caſes. Upon the Nomination of <hi>Jehu,</hi> God's Will was made ſo evident, that all men concern'd to take notice of it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did nor could doubt of it: but in the caſe of the Doctor's Hypotheſis 'tis the only thing in queſtion. And not only all men elſe, but the Doctor himſelf, not only doubted of it, but believ'd the clean contrary.</p>
            <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">Convoc. p. 52.</note> When God ſet up a King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or contrary to a legal Right, that King was immediately inveſted with his Authority, and as the Convocation ſpeaks of <hi>Ahud, Independent of any but God himſelf;</hi> he had the ſole Right to the Government, and the People were bound to ſubmit to him without any more ado, upon the account of God's Donation. But the Doctor's King, whom he ſays is of God's ſetting up too, is quite another thing; he is no King, or if he is, he has no Subjects, till the People have conſented; they are not bound to obey him upon the account of God's gift, till themſelves have conſented: And ſo for any thing that I can ſee, notwithſtanding God's ſetting up a King, the People may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe him, and are not bound to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him, except themſelves pleaſe.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107829:14"/> pulled down hath his Right ſtill and may juſtly recover the Throne, if he can, which is one of the fineſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of God's giving away another Princes Crown as ever was heard of. And I wonder when the Doctor will prove, that God ever gave away any Princes Crown, when notwithſtanding he had ſtill a Right to it, and might juſtly recover it.<note place="margin">Poſtſcript. p. 2.</note> And this I had told him before, but he takes no notice of it, altho it deſerves as much <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> as any of the reſt. But ſome things will not be <hi>vindicated</hi> how much ſoever they need it, and it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to require any man to <hi>vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> more than he can</p>
            <p>And this I think is ſufficient to ſhew how unreaſonably the Doctor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes from God's expreſs nomination to providence, and from God's Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty in diſpoſing of Kingdoms, to providential Poſſeſſion; and all that I have further to ſay is, that I expect the Doctor in his next will call me Atheiſt, or ſome hard name, and tell me people will be tempted to ſuſpect I do not believe, or that I ridicule God's Sovereignty, becauſe I do not believe the Doctor's unreaſonable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and Arguments from it, as he tells me they will be apt to ſuſpect I do not believe or that I <hi>ridicule</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 58.</note> becauſe I do not believe the ſoul conſequences he draws from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To confirm the Doctor's Interpretation, he tells us he obſerved that the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion teaches,</hi>

He replies, <hi>This is a bold undertaker.</hi> And that I ſuppoſe I am to take for an Anſwer, for he ſays very little beſide to the proofs I brought for it. But let us conſider what he does ſay.</p>
            <p>He tells us, <hi>Our firſt Inquiry is what the Convocation thought of the Kings of the</hi> Aramites <hi>and</hi> Moabites, <hi>Whether they thought them legal and rightful Kings of</hi> Iſrael? <hi>They</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>call indeed the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>their</hi> Subjects <hi>as our Author obſerves, and from thence proves that theſe Kings had a legal Power over</hi> Iſrael. <hi>But the miſchief is, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation in expreſs words owns them to be only Kings</hi> de facto, <hi>to whom they were in ſubjection; and teaches, that if any perſon born a Subject, and affirming by all the Arguments,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that God had called him to murder the King</hi> de facto <hi>under whom he lived,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which</hi> (ſays the Doctor) <hi>is ſpoke with reference to</hi> Ahud<hi>'s killing King</hi> Eglon, <hi>who it ſeems was</hi> but <hi>a King</hi> de facto <hi>in the jugd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Convocation. And I ſuppoſe our Author knows what a King</hi> de facto <hi>ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in oppoſition to a King</hi> de jure, <hi>one who is King without a</hi> Legal <hi>Right.</hi> I anſwer yes, I do know that, but the miſchief is, the Convocation does not ſpeak of a King <hi>de facto</hi> in oppoſition to a King <hi>de jure,</hi> but barely of a King <hi>de facto,</hi> and I ſuppoſe the Doctor <hi>knows,</hi> that a King <hi>de facto</hi> when it is not ſpoken in oppoſition to a King <hi>de jure,</hi> does not mean a King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a legal Right. And this is plainly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107829:14"/> the caſe; for (1) it is barely and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly expreſſed without any oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a King <hi>de jure</hi> either mention'd or ſuppos'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The matter plainly proves that it cannot be ſpoken in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to a King <hi>de jure,</hi> which is that the King <hi>de facto</hi> may not be murdered by his Subjects, but if a King <hi>de facto</hi> was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in oppoſition to a King <hi>de jure,</hi> then a King <hi>de jure</hi> may be murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Subjects.</p>

The Doctor tells us, that this is ſpoken with reference to <hi>Ahud</hi>'s kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King <hi>Eglon,</hi> and therefore King <hi>Eglon</hi> was but a King <hi>de facto.</hi> But then this is a reaſon that the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not ſpeak it in oppoſition to a King <hi>de jure;</hi> for in the Chapter to this Canon, they ſpeak with reference to the ſame, <hi>That the Lord may and is able to overthrow any Kings or Emperors notwithſtanding any</hi> Claim, Right, Title <hi>or Intereſt which they can challenge to their Countries, Kingdoms or Empires.</hi> Theſe words were plainly ſpoken with reference to <hi>Ahud</hi>'s killing King <hi>Eglon,</hi> and the Convocation prefaces thus: Both which Examples (<hi>i. e.</hi> of <hi>Jehu</hi> and <hi>Ahud</hi>) do make it known to us, that although the Lord may and is able to overthrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor tells us but the page before,<note place="margin">P. 9.</note> that there is no ſenſe to be made of theſe words, if they do not prove God's ſovereign Authority to remove and pull down the <hi>moſt</hi> rightful Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this was ſpoken with reference to God's pulling down King <hi>Eglon</hi> by <hi>Ahud.</hi> But then <hi>Eglon</hi> was ſo far from being a King <hi>de facto</hi> in oppoſition to a King <hi>de jure,</hi> that he was not only a rightful King, but a <hi>moſt</hi> rightful King. And therefore the miſchief (the Doctor ſpeaks of) that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation in <hi>expreſs words</hi> owns the Kings of the <hi>Aramites</hi> and <hi>Moabites</hi> to be <hi>only</hi> Kings <hi>de facto,</hi> is no other miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief but that the Doctor contradicts himſelf, but that is no miſchief with him, otherwiſe he would not uſe it ſo often. And here we plainly ſee the Doctor's admirable dexterity in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the Convocation to his own purpoſe. The Convocation ſays <hi>King de facto</hi> and no more, but it ſeems that would not do, and therefore the Doctor ſays, they ſay <hi>only</hi> King <hi>de fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto,</hi> and <hi>but</hi> King <hi>de facto;</hi> but theſe Additions (which perfectly alter the ſenſe) are no bodies but his own, and yet it ſeems it was not enough to put them in, but he muſt tell us alſo, the Convocation in <hi>expreſs words</hi> owns them to be <hi>only</hi> Kings <hi>de facto,</hi> when the Convocation hath not any ſuch word, or any thing like it.</p>
            <p>The Doctor proceeds,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Let us now ſee what legal Right and Title our Author hath found, for the Kings of the</hi> Aramites <hi>and</hi> Moabites <hi>and</hi> Babylonians <hi>over</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>and for all the four Monarchies; and that is the ſubmiſſion both of Prince and People.</hi> Well, that is one of them, but not all, <hi>which</hi> (ſays the Doctor) <hi>he ſays I grant gives a legal Right,<note place="margin">Poſtſcrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And I think alſo, that ſaying <hi>he tells us</hi> differs a little from ſaying <hi>he grants.</hi> So that I think this might have been ſpared: But the Doctor had a mind to charge me with a fault, and he hath thereby ſhew'd himſelf to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty of it. However I take this opportunity to tell him, that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to me, whether or no he grants that the ſubmiſſion of the Prince and People confer a legal Right, all the world beſides grant it, and that is ſufficient for any ordinary Principle

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>But now the Doctor tells me, <hi>The truth is our Author is here blundered for want of clear and diſtinct Notions of what he writes, and impoſes upon himſelf and others with ambiguous terms.</hi> This is a terrible buſineſs if the Doctor could but ſhew us where this blundering and theſe ambiguous terms were. I had told him as plain as I could ſpeak, that beſides lineal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, <hi>a Right to a Government might be acquir'd by the death or ceſſion of the right heir, joyn'd with the conſent of the People, and by Preſcription; and when ſuch a Right reſpectively was attain'd, the Government was then a legal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> I think this is diſtinct enough, and the Notions are clear enough: and if the Doctor would have given a direct Anſwer, he ſhould have ſhewn that either a Right to a Government by theſe ways is not attain'd, or if it be, that the Governments the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation ſpeaks of, and requires Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to, had not attain'd ſuch a Right: but inſtead of that he runs on with a company of diſtinctions about <hi>legal,</hi> and learnedly ſhews how many ſeveral ways Powers may be ſaid to be <hi>legal.</hi> And what is all that to me, and to the purpoſe? By legal Powers I underſtand what he underſtands by them, if he underſtands any thing by them, and that is legal Powers in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to uſurped Powers. Uſurped Powers are ſuch as have no Right, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Powers are ſuch as have a Right, as well a Right acquir'd, as by lineal deſcent, and ſuch Powers by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all mankind are legal Powers, and Uſurpers the contrary. And the Doctor knows well enough this is my ſenſe, and hath quoted it too but two or three pages before: but the truth is,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 6.</note> the Doctor is blunder'd for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; and to avoid giving a clear and diſtinct Anſwer, falls a diſtinguiſhing to no purpoſe at all, and on pretence of truly ſtating, confounds the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and runs from it, which is blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering with a witneſs. Has the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation any thing to do with his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions? When they call the Roman Governors the <hi>lawful Magiſtrates</hi> of the Jews, do they mean <hi>lawful</hi> by the law of Nature? And this I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned:<note place="margin">Poſtſcript p. 3.</note> and he will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly anſwer, but hides himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diſtinctions, and tells us fine things of a ſtate of nature when all men are free, and may diſpoſe of themſelves as they will, and of Conqueſt and a prevailing force, when they have the ſame liberty as in a ſtate of nature. And what is all this to a King by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> and to the <hi>Convocation book?</hi> If the Doctor has a mind to put the matter upon that iſſue, let him give his reaſons, and I will ſubmit to them, or anſwer them. But for my part, I love to end one Controverſie before I begin another, and do not much care to be drawn from the matter in hand by impertinent Diſtinctions which are nothing to the purpoſe. Well! but the Doctor tells us, <hi>That</hi> Legal <hi>(as it reſpects the Laws and Conſtitutions of a particular Nation or Kingdom) is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by all men, who underſtand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in this controverſie of</hi> Legal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. <hi>This is the reaſon of the diſtinction between a King</hi> de jure <hi>and a King</hi> de facto; <hi>a King</hi> de jure <hi>is a rightful King by the Laws of the Land, a King</hi> de facto <hi>whatever Right he may have is not rightfully and lawfully poſſeſs'd of the Crown, by the Laws of Succeſſion, proper to that Kingdom. And this</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is all the myſtery I intended.</hi> That is to ſay, the Doctor hath written two books to prove that a perſon who is not next Heir may be King and have God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: a wonderful diſcovery! I had told him ſo over and over, and ſhew'd him in what Caſes, when a Right was
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107829:15"/> acquir'd by <hi>Death, Ceſſion,</hi> or <hi>Preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</hi> But this it ſeems is <hi>blundering, ambiguous,</hi> and a man does <hi>not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi> himſelf. But to ſay that the ſame thing is by the <hi>Conſent and Submiſſion of the People,</hi> this is very clear and diſtinct, and the Doctor underſtands himſelf, tho no body elſe except ſome Commonwealths men, are able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it. But this is nothing but ſhifting the Queſtion, and the Doctor (I'll warrant you) does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the force of my Argument; and yet he tells us here, <hi>Let us ſee what Legal Right and Title our Author hath found for the Kings of the</hi> Aramites <hi>and the Moabites, and for the four Monarchies, and that is the ſubmiſſion both of Prince and People.</hi> Very well, and why did not he give a direct Anſwer to that? Does the ſubmiſſion of the Prince and People make ſuch a Government a <hi>legal</hi> Government and no Uſurpation? And the next Queſtion is, Had not the <hi>Aramites, Moabites, Babylonians,</hi> and all the Governments the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion juſtifie Obedience to, <hi>ſuch</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Submiſſion? and if they had then they were legal Kings and not Uſurpers. And this was the ſubſtance of my Anſwer, and to which I had added for Confirmation, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation mentions but two Uſurpers (<hi>Athaliah</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi>) and juſtifies the Reſiſtance of them both. And what does the Doctor ſay to this? Why firſt of all I am a <hi>bold Undertaker,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly 'tis <hi>blundering and ambiguous,</hi> and laſt of all there are ſeveral ſences of <hi>Legal;</hi> and if there were as many hundred <hi>ſenecs</hi> of <hi>Legal</hi> what is that to the purpoſe? I uſe it but in one <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and that is in oppoſition to <hi>Uſurpation,</hi> and ſo all men elſe uſe it, in the diſpute between <hi>legal</hi> and <hi>uſurped</hi> Powers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Doctor thinks they underſtand themſelves or no. But here is a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der point, the Doctor cannot deny it, and yet is unwilling to own it; it would be ridiculous for a man that talks ſo much of the Conſent and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the <hi>People,</hi> to deny that the Submiſſion of the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>People</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether did not transfer a Right to the Government; and if he ſhould own it, then he muſt own likewiſe that all the Governments the Convocation require Obedience to, had acquir'd <hi>ſuch</hi> a Right, And therefore it was far better to make Diſtinctions and ask Queſtions to obſcure the buſineſs, than to bring the plain matter in controverſie on foot by a direct and categorical An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. But the Doctor tells me <hi>ſuch le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Rights as I have found for theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will quickly tranſubſtantiate all Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Powers into Legal Governments.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 10.</note> Not all ſure, for I expreſly limit it to the acquiſition of Right by the Death or Ceſſion of the right Heir, and by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription: and if the Doctor pleaſe, I except one, and he may prove it if he can, that is a Government by the Conſent and Submiſſion of the People in oppoſition to the actual claims and pretences of an undoubted rightful King; which is as directly contrary to the Rights I have mention'd as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's thorough Settlement is to that of the Convocation.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to the Doctor's ſaying <hi>that the Kings of the</hi> Aramites <hi>and</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abites <hi>could have no legal Right to the Government of</hi> Iſrael, I had ſaid <hi>they had a legal Right, if the Submiſſion of the Prince could transfer a legal Right, which the Doctor ſaid it might be thought to do.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 12.</note> Now the Doctor tells us <hi>all the myſtery he intended</hi> was that That could not <hi>be according to the Conſtitution of the Jewiſh Commonwealth,</hi> &amp;c. And what then, Could it not be by the Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Governors and People? That was the thing which I aſſerted, and which the Doctor was to diſprove.</p>
            <p>But to this I made an Objection,<note place="margin">Poſtſcript. p. 3.</note> 
               <hi>If it be ſaid that God was at that time their Sovereign, and he did not ſubmit, 'tis
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107829:16"/> true he did not, but the Text ſays expreſly that God delivered them into their hands.</hi> This the Doctor ſays made him <hi>ſmile,</hi> for I had <hi>ſtarted an Objection which I knew not what to do with. And the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is as extravagant as the Objection, for</hi> (ſays he) <hi>he has found out ſomething which he thinks equivalent to God's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the</hi> Aramites <hi>and</hi> Moabites, <hi>and that is,</hi> that God had delivered them into their hands. <hi>What then? Did God reſign his Government of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the</hi> Aramites <hi>and</hi> Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, <hi>and quit his Right and Claim to the Government of them?</hi> Spectatum ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſi. — Let the Doctor's friends ſmile as well as himſelf. Now I do not know what force there may be in <hi>ſmiling,</hi> but I have ſeen that uſed when men have nothing to anſwer. And whether that be the caſe I ſhall refer to the Reader. And here I ſhall do two things, 1. I ſhall vindicate the Anſwer I have given, and 2. Conſider what the Doctor offers to juſtifie the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Subjection of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To vindicate the Anſwer: And the firſt thing I have to obſerve is that there is no incongruity in the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (as ridiculous as the Doctor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents it) to ſay that God may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign his immediate Government over a People as their political King. This was done in fact upon the ceaſing of the <hi>Theocracy</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah.</hi> Now in the preſent caſe the Text ſaith expreſly that <hi>God delivered them into the hands of the</hi> Moabites <hi>and</hi> Aramites. And what does that intimate, but that God had ſo far parted with his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Government as their political King? for if God was at that time their political King, how came the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> to be the <hi>Subjects</hi> of theſe Kings? Might they transferr their Alleg. from God too, when he inſiſted upon his Right to govern them? But if God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them (for the puniſhment of their ſins) to be <hi>Subjects</hi> to thoſe Kings, and delivered them as ſuch into their hands, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> knew that he did ſo, it is plain that God ſo far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented that they ſhould be their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. And tho the Doctor will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the preſumed <hi>conſent</hi> of the Prince ſignifies any thing, I hope he will not think ſo of the expreſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of God. Now the Convocation plainly aſſerts that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were the <hi>Subjects</hi> of theſe Kings, and the Doctor's Argument proceeds upon the ſuppoſition of it. And the Queſtion is how they became ſo? Either God at that time was their political King, or he was not; if he was, Which way ſhould they become <hi>Subyects</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince? I doubt, for all his laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it will puzzle the Doctor to give another account of it. If God was not their political King, then thoſe in whom the Right of the Government was, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the People, had ſubmitted, and had thereby made the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Aramites</hi> and <hi>Moabites</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them <hi>Legal Governments.</hi> But of this more preſently.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To conſider what the Doctor hath found out to juſtifie the Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and their beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Subjects to theſe things. And here we are got into a field of <hi>Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> and nothing at all to the purpoſe. And the Doctor will <hi>grant Legal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may be underſtood in a larger Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that may be ſaid to be legal which is agreeable to the Laws of Nature and Nations, and Submiſſion may make a legal King of him who according to the Laws of the Land can be only King</hi> de facto. And this he tells us is <hi>worth conſidering,</hi> and then goes on. <hi>In a ſtate of Nature wherein we muſt ſuppoſe all men free from any Government but that of Parents, and ſo might give up the Government of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to whom they pleaſed,</hi> &amp;c. But what is this to the purpoſe? Was that the Caſe of the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> whom
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107829:16"/> God himſelf had framed into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth? and eſpecially at ſuch times when he was their political King? But (ſays he) <hi>If we fall into a ſtate of Nature and Liberty again,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 13.</note> 
               <hi>or ſomething like it, as in the caſe of a new prevailing force, when Prince and People are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd, for then the Government is at an end, and they are as much at liberty to ſubmit to a conquering Prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, as they were in the ſtate of Nature.</hi> Now this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly a new Queſtion, and I ſee no reaſon to meddle with it; but if the Doctor is weary of his Hypotheſis as he hath laid it, and will quit it as not defenſible, and will fix the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie upon this bottom, he ſhall hear what I have to ſay to it. But the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor (I ſuppoſe thinking it not much to the purpoſe) hath himſelf enlarg'd this point. And with reſpect to <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Subjects,</hi> he ſays, <hi>When upon a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent change of Government they are as much under the force and power of a new Prince, or a new Government as they could be under a conquering Prince, Force will juſtifie Submiſſion, and then it is the ſame thing from what quarter the force comes.</hi> And agreeable to this he ſays, <hi>in matters of Government it is an unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Right of Nature to ſubmit to Force.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And this is that which he gives as a Reaſon to juſtifie the Submiſſion of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to the <hi>Aramites</hi> and <hi>Moabites;</hi> for it follows, <hi>All men will grant that no humane Laws and Conſtitutions are ſo ſacred as the poſitive Laws of God; that Government and Polity which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf preſcribed to the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>which they were religiouſly bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve by vertue of their Covenant with God, which certainly was as ſacred as any oath. Now thoſe Laws did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of the Authority and Government of Strangers, but expreſly forbad it, that had they choſe to be governed by any foreign Prince, they had greatly ſinned in it; but this very Law, as ſacred as it was, gave way to neceſſity; and when they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd by the</hi> Aramites <hi>or</hi> Moabites, <hi>or any other Nation, it was no fault to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to them. And if force would juſtifie this in the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>who had God for their King, and were oblig'd by their Covenant with him to accept of no foreign Prince to govern them, it is hard if it will not juſtifie the Subjects of humane Governments (moſt of which were at first founded in mere force, whatever their Oaths and Obligations be to ſubmit to a new and greater force.</hi> This is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſtate of the matter, and I ſhall conſider it immediately.</p>
            <p>For the Doctor ſays, <hi>This gives a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Anſwer to what our Author adds in the place laſt quoted,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Poſtſcript p. 3.</note> That God's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>would be an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt their ſubmiſſion; for the Doctor tells us, that where God entails the Crown, the People were not to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to any Uſurp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r if the right Heir was alive, and therefore much more</hi> where God himſelf was their King, and then ſure they might lawfully reſiſt thoſe Kings, whoſe Subjects they were not nor could be, and they needed no eſpecial direction to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Uſurpers, as <hi>Ahud</hi> did King <hi>Eglon,</hi> but they might, nay they were bound to do it, as <hi>Jehoiada</hi> ſlew <hi>Athaliah;</hi> for I hope God's entail is not of greater force than his own immediate Government. So that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Submiſſion transferr'd a legal Right, or their Submiſſion was a ſin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this the Doctor replies,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 15.</note> 
               <hi>This looks like ſomething very deep,</hi> but it is ſo very a nothing, that <hi>I cannot deviſe what he would be at:</hi> that is, becauſe the Doctor has nothing to ſay to it. For now he comes to another of his ſhifts; juſt before inſtead of giving a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Anſwer he brings a company of impertinent Diſtinctions to blind the buſineſs, and in the miſt drops the Queſtion, and now inſtead of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering one Queſtion, falls to asking I know not how many. <hi>Would he prove that God was not the King of</hi> Iſrael

This I think is as clear againſt the uſe the Doctor makes of this Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as any thing can be, and all his little ſhifts of the heir <hi>being known,</hi> of <hi>anointing</hi> him,<note place="margin">Vindic. p.</note> and of his <hi>actual Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion</hi> will ſignifie nothing here, with reſpect to God's immediate Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107829:17"/> of nature, which allow ſubmiſſion to a Conqueror, it did.</hi> Very well; then pray what becomes of <hi>Nothing can ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the Submiſſion to an Uſurper when the Kings ſon was found,</hi> and <hi>Subjects are bound to adhere to their Prince of God's chuſing, when known, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute all Uſurpers to the utmoſt, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſubmit to their Government.</hi> I had thought that <hi>nothing</hi> and <hi>never</hi> would have excluded <hi>Force</hi> as well as any thing elſe, and I thought likewiſe that <hi>ſubmitting</hi> to Uſurpers, <hi>had not been proſecuting them to the utmoſt, and never ſubmitting to their Government;</hi> and I deſire the Doctor in his next to ſhew me how to reconcile them.</p>
            <p>But to leave the Doctor to reconcile his Contradictions as well as he can, let us a little conſider his new ſtate, the ſum of which is, <hi>That Force will juſtifie Submiſſion from what quarter ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it comes; that in matters of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is an unalterable Right of Nature to ſubmit to force; that Force juſtified the Submiſſion of the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>tho they had God for their King, and tho they were oblig'd by their Covenant with him not to accept ſuch Kings to govern them;</hi> and that by parity of reaſon, it <hi>will juſtifie the Subjects of humane Governments whatever their Oaths and Obligations be.</hi> Now from hence I have theſe things to obſerve.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this is nothing to his <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis;</hi> for what is ſubmitting to force to a providential King, and God's Authority?

But if poſſible, 'tis more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant and dangerous than that: for,</p>

It cancels and diſſolves the moſt ſacred Obligations, and warrants the entring into other Obligations in direct oppoſition and contradiction to what they ſtand in the moſt holy and ſolemn manner bound to God and Man. For by <hi>Submiſſion to Force</hi> the Doctor does not mean a paſſive Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion (which no body diſputes) but an active concurrence and conjunction with it, to own and ſupport it, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Subjects to it, and ſwear an Oath of Alleg. to defend it againſt all men. Now this is the ſingle Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Will all the Force in the world juſtifie the maintaining and defending it againſt Right?

God forbids them to chuſe a King of their own heads, therefore they muſt not ſubmit to another Prince when they have no King, or when the King of God's chuſing hath himſelf ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. It had been a little more perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the Doctor's purpoſe, if he could but have prov'd it, to have ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that when God had given them a King, and they were under an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, That Force would have juſtified their deſerting their King of Gods chooſing, and engaging to maintain and defend the poſſeſſion of the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per againſt him. The Doctor adds, <hi>If Force would juſtifie this in the</hi> Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, <hi>who had God for their King, and were oblig'd by their Covenant with him, to accept of no foreign Prince to govern them.</hi> Now this I take to be ſtrange Doctrine: for as the Doctor hath ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the matter with reſpect to the Submiſſion of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> it contains this admirable Propoſition, That Force will diſengage Men from their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and juſtifie them to <hi>covenant</hi> directly and expreſly againſt it. For if by vertue of their Covenant with God they were oblig'd to accept of no foreign Prince to govern them, yet when they were under the power of ſuch a Prince, they might covenant with him to ſtand by him and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him againſt all Oppoſers (which is the import of ſwearing to him, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107829:18"/> becoming his Subjects) then by virtue of force they may make new Covenants of themſelves, in direct oppoſition to the Covenant they ſtand in to God. And ſo I perceive, that the Covenants God makes with his People, are no better than Oaths of Allegiance; the Dr. in the next Page asks me a curious Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>would he prove that the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>ought not to have ſubmitted to the</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abites, <hi>but have had all their throats out by a vain oppoſition?</hi> No by no means ſure! let them firſt break their Covenant with God, and a thouſand Oaths rather than have <hi>their Throats out.</hi>

               </gap> be not ſubmitting to him? And therefore, in anſwer I ſhall only tell him, that 'tis every jot as good a ſubmiſſion, as the Doctor's notion of a Settlement is a Settlement, <hi>i. e.</hi> 'tis none at all. <hi>But</hi> (ſays he) <hi>if nothing be</hi> a ſubmiſſion, but renouncing his Right, and making <hi>a formal reſignation and conveyance of power;</hi> that is, I ſuppoſe, under hand and ſeal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and before ſufficient witneſſes. But what now, if nothing of that be neceſſary? what if a virtual Reſignation be ſufficient? When the King of <hi>Spain</hi> treated witht the united Provinces as a Soveraign State; all the World were ſatisfied, that that was a Ceſſion; and ſo is the ſubmitting to be a Subject, or other equivalent acts, tho there be no formal conveyance of Power. And now the Doctor <hi>deſires to know how the Author will prove, that the</hi> Iſraelites thus <hi>ſubmitted to the</hi> Aramites, Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, <hi>or</hi> Babylonians. I tell him, I will not prove that they made a formal Reſignation. And there is no need to prove the other, for they actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came their Subjects; nay, the Doctor ſays, <hi>what other ſubmiſſion they made but a bare yielding to force and power;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 13.</note> and that proves it too, for he tells us, <hi>that is a voluntary conſent, the extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by force, as all Moraliſts allow ſuch a mixt choice and election to be</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The next main Queſtion the Doctor asks is, <hi>Can the ſubmiſſion of the King give a Legal Right to the Crown, without the ſubmiſſion of the People?</hi> I had told him no, but both together, and what then; <hi>if not</hi> (ſays he) <hi>it ſeems the People may have ſome Right, if not to the Government, yet to give away the Goverment of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> Some Right? no doubt of it, the Prince cannot give the Government of the People to whom he pleaſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their own conſent? and therefore what? The People may give it away without his conſent? that I think will hardly follow; the People have ſome Right, but have they all? and to be ſure they can give away no more Right than they have; and what is their Right, they have a Right not to be diſpos'd of to any Prince beſides their own, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their own conſent. But have they any Right to throw off their own King and take another? yes, ſays he, <hi>if the conſent and ſubmiſſion of a People can make a King when they have none, why can it not do ſo, when they are under a new force and power, which is the ſame ſtate, as if they had no King?</hi> that is becauſe when they are free, and have no King, they may make one; therefore when they are not free, and when they have a King, they may make another King. This is a pure conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the reaſon why they may make a King when they have none, is becauſe the power is then in them, and they may delegate it, or diſpoſe it as they pleaſe, or they may take it themſelves;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107829:21"/> but the Queſtion is, whether they can give it when they have it not; and the being under force is a pretty odd reaſon that they have it: But ſaith he, <hi>it is the ſame ſtate, as if they had no King;</hi> not quite the <hi>ſame ſtate</hi> ſure, for if they had no King the Sovereign Power was in them, and then they might give it away, becauſe they would give away no more than their own.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His next Queſtion is, <hi>Can't every Private man, or any City or Garriſon, when they are over-powered and cannot be relieved by their Prince, ſubmit for themſelves to the Conqueror, without the ſubmiſſion of their Kings?</hi> I pray mark the conſequence, and therefore the ſubmiſſion of the Prince and People does not give a Legal Right; for that was the thing the Doctor was to prove here; but inſtead of that, he asks ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Queſtion, <hi>do they not by ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, according to the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, become the Subjects of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror till they are retaken?</hi> Now theſe the Doctor takes for granted, and proceeds upon it, and draws a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from thence, that therefore a whole Nation may do ſo, but for all that there is nothing more extravagant, and no man believes it. Does a private man when he is taken Priſoner, or a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of men when they are overpowered and taken, forthwith become the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the Conqueror? all the World knows the contrary when a Garriſon is taken, the Walls and Bulwarks are the Conquerors; but the men are his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and not his Subjects. But it ſeems according to the Dr. Men are taken like Beaſts, nay like the wildeſt ſort <hi>(ferae naturae)</hi> the property fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Poſſeſſion: But every Soldier can teach him a better Doctrine; In the Wars heretofore, and even in thoſe now in the World, how few inſtances are theſe of the Subjects of one Prince (I except Soldiers of fortune not Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) who when taken Priſoners have liſted themſelves, and taken pay under the enemy, and actually fought againſt their own King and Maſter. Some ſuch Renegadoes there have been; but they have always been branded with Infamy, and if retaken are ſure to pay for it; for to treat ſuch perfidious violators of their Faith and Honour, as the worſt of enemies, has been the practice of all Princes and all Nations. And yet the Dr. in this caſe appeals to the Law of Nations; by which, he tells us before, he means general practice and uſage: I am content to let that decide the point; and if a Soldier changing ſides (upon his being taken) and taking pay under the enemy againſt his own King, be in the eſtimate of the World perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to a high degree, and a man of no honour; then the Doctor's Principles (maintaining he may do ſo) are neither Principles of Honour, nor Conſcience.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He has another Queſtion, <hi>Has a Nation no right when the King is gone, to preſerve themſelves by making the beſt terms they can with the new powers?</hi> yes, no doubt the beſt terms they can honeſtly. But where is the conſequence again, and therefore the ſubmiſſion of the Prince and People cannot give a Legal Right; he tells us his Queſtions are in anſwer to that.</p>
            <p n="5">5. His next is a very pleaſant Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>For what will our Author ſay to the ſubmiſſion of</hi> Jaddus <hi>and the</hi> Jews <hi>to</hi> Alexander, <hi>while</hi> Darius <hi>was living.</hi> Now the Dr. knows well enough, I have ſaid more to it than he hath anſwer'd, or than he will anſwer in haſt; and he tells us, he will not engage in the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, but aſſigns me over to a more learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anſwerer, and yet asks me what I will ſay to it. This is extraordinary, and I muſt confeſs a very dextrous way of anſwering. But however, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the caſe of <hi>Jaddus</hi> I ſhall exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it altogether, and when I come to conſider the <hi>Vindicator</hi> of <hi>Joſeph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>.</hi> I ſhall not forget what the Dr. offers in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107829:22"/> that caſe, that the <hi>Vindicator</hi> does not mention, and that is but very little.</p>
            <p>The next thing is the Caſe of <hi>Joaſh</hi> and <hi>Athaliah,</hi> the ſtory of which in the Convocation the Dr repeats at large, and thither I refer the Reader, not thinking it neceſſary to tranſcribe it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſw. p. 17.</note>My Argument from thence, which the Dr. cites truely was this; <q>It is plain the Convocation does not conceive, that the injoyment of the Crown with all its dignities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is that thorough Settlement to which is due ſubjection and obedience as to God's Authority. <hi>Athaliah</hi> perſonally injoyed the Crown with all its dignities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all places of truſt and power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were in her hands and at her diſpoſal </q>(which was the very account the Author I diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt had given of a thorough Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement) <q>and this for no leſs a time than ſix years, and in as full and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a manner, as any Uſurper or any Rightful King ever injoy'd them; but for all that the Convocation is ſo far from urging obedience to her, as to God's Authority, that they expreſly juſtifie the reſiſting, nay the ſlaying her. And this is a clear demonſtration, that by a thorough Settlement, the Convocation does not mean a full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of power meerly, for they ſay when a Government is fully ſetled, it ought to be obey'd as God's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not only for fear, but alſo for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake; but they ſay alſo, that when <hi>Athaliah</hi> was fully poſſeſſed, She ought not to be obey'd, but to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted and ſlain: And the concluſion from theſe premiſes is, that to be fully poſſeſſed of the Throne, is not of it ſelf to be ſo throughly ſetled as to make it God's Authority, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to become a duty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">p. 22.</note>To this the Dr. anſwers: <hi>Now it were ſufficient to obſerve here, that he has not given the true notion of a full and ſetled poſſeſſion.</hi> That is, I had not ſaid that <hi>Athaliah</hi> was ſetled on the Throne, according to the Convocations ſenſe of a Settlement, and I wonder how I ſhould, when I had expreſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted the contrary, and the deſign of the Argument is to prove it; but for all that the Dr. is reſolv'd to make me ſay it, whether I will or no; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he goes to prove againſt me, <hi>that the Convocation ſays not one word of the thorough Settlement of</hi> Athali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah <hi>in the Throne, but if we may learn the ſenſe of the Convocation (as this Author concludes we may) from Biſhop</hi> Buckeridge, <hi>they did not think her ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Throne;</hi> very Right, and did not I ſay ſo? And I thought I had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a good reaſon for it. But then I wonder what makes the Dr. ſay, <hi>thus his whole Argument is loſt,</hi> that is, it is loſt, becauſe the Dr. hath prov'd it. But I doubt his Argument is loſt, for he aſſerts, <hi>that the Poſſeſſion of the Throne, and the ſubmiſſion of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple makes a thorough Settlement.</hi> And tho I do not ſay, that the People of <hi>Judah</hi> ſubmitted (in ſuch a ſenſe as to become Subjects) to <hi>Athaliah;</hi> yet the Dr. ſays it, and ſays they ought to be <hi>juſtified in it.</hi> But then, if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Athaliahs</hi> Poſſeſſion of the Throne, and the Peoples ſubmiſſion to her; The Convocation ſays not a word of her thorough Settlement, nor did think her ſetled on the Throne: It is as plain as the Sun, that by a <hi>thorough Settlement;</hi> they did not mean the Poſſeſſion of the Throne, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the People; for according to the Dr. <hi>Athaliah</hi> had both, and yet the Convocation did not think her ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and therefore there muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe go to a thorough Settlement, and the Dr. may try his skill, if he can find any thing beſides the <hi>acquiſition of Right.</hi> And thus the Drs. <hi>Argument is loſt,</hi> if to have it perfectly confuted from his own words, is to have it loſt. But no matter for that, let the Drs. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſuffer never ſo much by it,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107829:22"/> he will have me ſay, that <hi>Athaliah</hi> was throughly ſetled, and makes me believe he does me a great kindneſs to admit it, for ſays he, <hi>to gratifie our Author, let us ſuppoſe the Convocation did own</hi> Athaliah <hi>to have been as throughly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Throne;</hi>

            <p>But the Dr. gives a reaſon, why I have not given the true notion of a full and ſetled Poſſeſſion, for (ſaith he) he <hi>hath left out the principal part of it, as I ſtate it, when the Eſtates of the Realm, and the great body of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has ſubmitted to ſuch a Prince.</hi> Now it is true I have left it out, and how ſhould the Dr. expect I ſhould do otherwiſe; for he knows I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that is the true notion of a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and I do not believe that the Dr. can prove that it is: But I ſuppoſe the Dr. means, that becauſe I ſaid that <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> was fully poſſeſſed of the Throne, and did not ſay likewiſe, that the Eſtates of the Realm and the great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Nation ſubmitted to her; therefore my Argument does not affect him. And what the Convocation ſays of depoſing and ſlaying <hi>Athaliah,</hi> does not relate to a ſetled Government; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it appears, that according to the Drs. notion of it, the Eſtates of the Realm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had ſubmitted to her; and therefore a ſetled Government may have God's Authority, and ought to be obey'd, tho <hi>Athaliah</hi> had not God's Authority and might be depos'd, becauſe ſhe was not ſetled according to the Drs. account, by the ſubmiſſion of the Eſtates of the Realm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This I take to be his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tho he has not expreſs'd it; but I know I muſt be careful of giving his meaning, leaſt he be angry, and tell me again, he <hi>will anſwer for none of my ſenſes.</hi> And therefore if this be not his ſenſe,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 71.</note> I deſire him in his next to tell me what is, for I can make no other ſenſe of it; But methinks a man that is ſo very humourſom and touchy, ſhould be careful to deliver his ſenſe a little plainer, and not leave men to gueſs, and to make it out for him. But if that be his ſenſe, then I make this Anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I do own, that the People of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> (at leaſt the more conſcientious part of them) did not ſubmit to <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> ſo as to become her Subjects, and Parties to her Government. But I do believe notwithſtanding, that a great part of them, and perhaps the greateſt did ſide with her and abet her. For it is plain, that She had a Party enough to maintain her Government, and thoſe that would not own it were not able to oppoſe her. Had <hi>Jehoiada</hi> been ſtrong enough, I think there is no doubt but he would have depoſed her, and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed <hi>Joaſh</hi> long before. But at the end of ſix years, he had a great acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Party (which probably he had at that time been preparing and working them into a ſenſe of their duty to their lawful King) and there can hardly be given any other account, why he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Uſurpation ſo long; for if the mere ſhewing the King would have done it, and have turned the hearts of the People, <hi>that</hi> might as well have been done ſome years before; and the Kingdom have been ſet upon the Right bottom, and the miſchiefs of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Uſurpation have been prevented. But it is no wonder, that power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt ſhould prevail againſt Duty and Conſcience. Men in thoſe days as well as others might have their Principles corrupted, and their morals poyſoned, what Arguments they had to juſtifie themſelves by, does not appear (the Drs. two Books would have ſtored
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107829:23"/> them with abundance) but a little Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument with a great Intereſt, will go a great way. And it is plain, it was ſix years before they came to a ſenſe of their duty; and there is little doubt to be made, but <hi>Jehoiada</hi> travail'd all that time with them, to reduce them: and probably upon juſt Conviction, they deſerted the Uſurper, and joyn'd themſelves to <hi>Jehoiada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Queſtion is not, What they did, but what they ought to have done: That a great part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom did ſubmit to her, I think there is no diſpute; and it is as little, that a great many did not: and the Queſtion is. Who of theſe, according to the Principles of the Convocation, ought to be juſtified, and who ought to be condemn'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Dr. himſelf aſſerts, they did ſubmit; and ſo <hi>Athaliah</hi> was ſetled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Notion of a Settlement; and then my Argument affects him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Queſtion is not, What is the Drs. Notion, but what is the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's Notion of a Settlement? and I readily grant, that according to that, <hi>Athaliah</hi> was not ſetled; nor that they thought ſhe was: But the Reaſon is, becauſe ſhe was an Uſurper, and the Right Heir of the Kingdom was alive, and not becauſe the People had not ſubmitted. For, if they did ſubmit (as the Dr. ſays they did) that made no alteration in the Caſe; they were bound notwithſtanding to return to their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ki g, and to Depoſe the Uſurper, whether they had, or not ſubmitted. And the truth is, there is ſcarcely any thing the Convocation more obviates, than the Notion of <hi>Peoples Conſent</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing any thing to the Government, or to their own Duty. They expreſs it, <hi>Civil Power, Juriſdiction,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>deduced by their Conſents — depend upon their Conſents — did receive any ſuch vertue and ſtrength from the people.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 3. P. 8. P. 28.</note> Now 't s true, theſe are ſpoken with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Lawful Governments. But then I would fain ſee a good Reaſon, why the Peoples Submiſſion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which ſignifies nothing with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Lawful Governments, and their Duty to them, ſhould ſignifie ſo very much againſt the Lawful Government; or if the <hi>Peoples Conſent</hi> does not make Allegiance a Duty to Lawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, how comes it to make it a Duty to Uſurpation, in oppoſition to Lawful Governments?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Altho the Dr. here tells us, that the Principal part of a Settlement, is the Submiſſion of the Eſtates, and the great Body of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he does alſo in his Caſe of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance; yet when he comes to prove this, he himſelf hath left this Principal part quite out: for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer had ſaid, that Settlement is a Term of Law, and in the notion of it denoted a Rightful and Peaceable Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; and in Reply to this,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 5, 6.</note> the Dr. tells us, that when the Convocation ſpeaks of the Settlement of Powers which are againſt Law, <hi>it muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Settlement of Poſſeſſion, and the obvious Expoſition of Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſuch caſes is a Settlement of Poſſeſſion:</hi> And afterward,<note place="margin">P. 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>All the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation ſays, relates to the viſible and actual alterations of Government and Governors, which is matter of fact; and therefore the Settlement of ſuch alterations, is an Actual, not a Legal Settlement: And this brings the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to matter of Senſe, and an Actual and Viſible Settlement, is all that is requir'd to an Actual and Viſible Tranſlation of Kingdoms.</hi> But where is the Drs. <hi>Principal Part</hi> all this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So that here is nothing but the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Anſwer over and over again; but the firſt Anſwer is perfectly loſt, and the Doctor cannot maintain it, and has nothing to ſay for it; and he might have ſaid ſo, and there had been an end; but to quit it in the plain field, and yet to pretend to ſtand to it, to give nothing in Reply, but the Second Anſwer and yet dreſs it up, as if it had been the Firſt, ſavors more of Artifice, then Ingenuity or Reaſon. A little Ingenuity would have ſaved us both ſome pains. But ſome men, when they find fault with themſelves, and when it is for their turn, can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to own themſelves fallible, and are not <hi>aſham'd to own that they are ſtill learners;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Preface to the Caſe of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> but if any man elſe diſcovers their miſtakes, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide to own them, but will ſhift and double, and turn and wind any
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107829:24"/> way, rather than acknowledge a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake.</p>
            <p>But has the Doctor nothing at all to ſay for his Firſt Anſwer? Yes truly (to do him Right) he has ſomething to ſay, but it is next to nothing; and he had e'en as good have let it paſs, in all points, and aſſign'd the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs over to the Second Anſwer, as he hath done in every thing beſides.</p>
            <p>All that he ſays, is this: In the Firſt Anſwer to confirm what he ſaid, that all that they amounted to, was, that when the Legal and Rightful King is poſſeſs'd, Subjects may return to their Allegiance: <hi>For</hi> (ſays he) Joaſh <hi>was firſt anointed and proclaimed, before any one ſtirred a finger againſt</hi> Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah. To this I anſwer'd, <q>Is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ſure, that <hi>Joaſh</hi> was actually poſſeſs'd of the Throne? He was anointed indeed, but is anointing, actual poſſeſſion? And it will not be eaſie to prove it, according to the Doctor's notion of Poſſeſſion, of having the whole adminiſtration of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and all the Authority of the Kingdom in his hands.</q> To this he replies, <hi>The Convocation affirms, that King</hi> Joaſh <hi>was in poſſeſſion of his Crown before</hi> Athaliah <hi>was ſlain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 30.</note>And he further tells us, <q>That the Convocation thought it very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that the Princes, Levites, and People, yielded ſubjection to their lawful King; and having ſo done, and their King being in Poſſeſſion of the Throne, joyned together for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing <hi>Athaliah</hi> the Uſurper, if the Convocation had not thought that there was ſome difference between killing <hi>Athaliah, before</hi> or <hi>after</hi> the anointing of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> they would not have laid ſo much ſtreſs upon the time, when ſhe was ſlain.

The Convocation will not allow a private man to kill a King <hi>de facto;</hi> and that was the Caſe of the Jews during <hi>Athaliah</hi>'s Reign, before <hi>Joaſh</hi>'s Title was Recogniz'd, and he anointed, and placed on the Throne; but when this was done, they had the viſible and actual Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their King to ſlay the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</q> 
               <hi>And after,</hi> 
               <q>Thus whatever Authority <hi>Athaliah</hi> had before, when <hi>Joaſh</hi> was anointed, ſhe ſunk into the ſtate of a Subject, and then to kill her, was not to kill a Queen <hi>de facto,</hi> but a Subject, who had been an Uſurper, but now was a Subject again; and therefore no Fidelity or Allegiance was due to her.</q> Is not this pure Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from a Church of <hi>England</hi>-Man? As if in an Hereditary Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy (and one that was ſo by Divine En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail too, which the Doctor lays ſo much ſtreſs upon) the King could have no Authority to perform the Acts of Government till he was Anointed, and Crown'd, and his Title Recogniz'd by his Subjects. We are hard put to it ſure, when we muſt gather up the very dregs of the Common-wealth Principles, to ſupport our Hypotheſis. At this rate <hi>Athaliah</hi> had hard for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; for if ſhe had come a little ſooner, and before the Ceremony of Anointing had been over, ſhe had ſav'd her Life and her Authority too; and her crying out <hi>Treaſon, Treaſon,</hi> had been the true ſtate of the Caſe, and they had all been Traytors, in violating the Allegiance and Fidelity they ow'd to her: for the Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

Now, if the Doctor will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me one Queſtion, I will thank him. Did the Subjects of <hi>Judah</hi> owe Allegiance to <hi>Athaliah,</hi> till ſuch time as <hi>Joaſh</hi> was actually poſſeſs'd of the Throne, <hi>i. e.</hi> according to the Doctor, 'till he was actually anointed, then I deſire to know, how he came to be anointed by <hi>her</hi> Subjects, for that was not an act of Fidelity and Allegiance to her, but a contradiction to it: But if they did not owe her Allegiance, <hi>'till</hi> he was anointed, then (as the Doctor phraſeth it) ſhe was ſunk into lhe ſtate of a Subject before <hi>Joaſh</hi> was anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And her Character was loſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (if ever ſhe had any to loſe, for that the Doctor has not yet proved:)— And I believe if the Doctor looks again, he will find, that their anointing <hi>Joaſh,</hi> was an Evidence that they were his Subjects before, and not as he tells us, that they might return to their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance when he was actually poſſeſs'd of the Throne, <hi>i. e.</hi> in his ſenſe, when he was anointed; for their very anointing him, plainly ſhew'd they were his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and ſo own'd themſelves before: and the Convocation is as expreſs as can be.<note place="margin">Convoc. p. 41.</note>

So that their Allegiance d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d not commence from his anointing; nor ceaſe to <hi>Athaliah</hi> (if ever they pay'd any to her) upon his being in Actual Poſſeſſion (in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's ſenſe, and) as he would have it: and immediately it follows, <hi>which du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful office of Subjects being perform'd,</hi> that is, the dutiful Office of Crowning and Anointing. This it ſeems, was the Office of them that were Subjects, and not of ſuch as by that act were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo And to this purpoſe I had anſwer'd this matter before:<note place="margin">Poſtſcr. p.</note> 
               <q>The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor knows well enough, that his Anointing and Proclaiming, did not make him King, but that (according to the Rules of Succeſſion in that and other Kingdoms, he was King all the while of <hi>Athaliah</hi>'s Uſurpation, and Allegiance was due to him, and uppon the account of that they reſtor'd him.</q> But ſaith the Doctor, <hi>If the Convocation had not thought, that there was ſome difference between kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> Athaliah <hi>before or after the anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of</hi> Joaſh, <hi>they would not have laid ſo much ſtreſs upon the time, when ſhe was ſlain.</hi> Now it is true, the Convocation does mention the time, and ſeem to lay ſome weight upon <hi>Joaſh</hi>'s being in Poſſeſſion, and not without Reaſon; this Example of <hi>Jehoiada</hi> (and which the Doctor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) was urg'd by the Papiſts to juſtifie the Pope's Power of Depoſing Princes, and to refute this, that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Canon ſeems eſpecially to be directed.

As to the Firſt, they ſay <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> was an Uſurper, and no Queen without Right and Title; and what <hi>Jehoiada</hi> did, any other private man might have done: But not a word of the Doctor's fine limitation of her ſinking into the ſtate of a Subject when <hi>Joaſh</hi> was anointed: for they never thought her otherwiſe; only
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107829:25"/> they thought her a great deal worſe: The Doctor indeed ſprucely calls her a Queen, and is very tender as to the Point of ſlaying her; but they bluntly called her a Robber, and never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelves about the Punctilio and Ceremony of killing her.

               <hi>This is not to be called a depoſing a Queen, who was no Queen; but the taking venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a cruel Robber, and the diſcharge of the Allegiance of Subjects to their own King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Anſwer reſpects the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by which ſhe was depoſed and ſlain. And upon this they ſay, that any man hath Authority to kill an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. And Biſhop <hi>Buckeridge</hi> is very expreſs;<note place="margin">P. 923.</note> 
               <hi>If</hi> Athaliah <hi>was not a true Queen, but an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in this all are agreed, that ſhe may be killed by any Subject; becauſe no body is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to an Enemy. Furthermore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the order of that management is this,</hi> Jehoiada <hi>ſhews and declares, their true, lawful, and natural King: the Princes and People accept him, and then</hi> Jehoiada <hi>Crowns him; and after all that, they take</hi> Athaliah, <hi>and ſlay her,</hi> &amp;c. And now obſerve what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>If they had firſt depoſed</hi> Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah, <hi>and afterwards Declared and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>augurated King</hi> Joaſh (videri fortaſſe poterat) <hi>perhaps it might ſeem, that ſomething had been done by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Prieſt, or Nobles, or People; but ſeeing that the true King was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd in the firſt place, and in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, puniſhment was taken of the falſe Queen and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper; thoſe facts are known to be done by the Kingly Authority, and not by any Prieſtly Authority, or that of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, or People.</hi> From whence 'tis plain, there is not ſo much ſtreſs laid upon the anointing of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> as if <hi>Athaliah</hi> could not have been lawfully killed before, or without it, (as the Dr. fanſies) for they ſay any body might do it: but being done after, it was a clearer proof againſt the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>piſts, that it was done by the Authority Royal, and not Sacerdotal or Papal. And upon this account it ſeems, the Convocation was ſo punctual in reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the order of it,<note place="margin">Bellarm.</note> that the Proof might be yet clearer againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. For they urg'd, that both the Depoſing and Killing <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and the ſetting up of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> was done purely upon the Authority of <hi>Jehoiada</hi> as High Prieſt; and the order of it, as being done after <hi>Joaſh</hi> was Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Crown'd, was a proof without exception againſt them. And hereby an Objection is prevented: for if it had been done before, it might have been pretended, (as ſome Papiſts and Common-wealths men pretend, and the Dr. has given no ſmall Countenance to it) that <hi>Joaſh</hi> was not King, and that he had no Authority, 'till he was Crown'd; and therefore it muſt be done by the Authority of <hi>Jehioada.</hi> But it being done after, refutes all ſuch Cavils; and therefore there was reaſon enough for their mentioning and inſiſting upon his being Crown'd before <hi>Athaliah</hi> was ſlain; tho, they might believe, that <hi>Joaſh</hi> had ſufficient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to perform all Acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well before, as after ſuch Anointing and Crowning. And that they did ſo, is as plain as words can expreſs it. For ſpeaking of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Judah,</hi> this they ſay expreſly, <q>After that the Kingdom was held by Succ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> they were
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107829:26"/> thereby impow'red to do any Acts of Government; and the Uſurper might have been ſlain, as juſtly by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> as well before, as after his Anointing.</p>
            <p>But all this is meer trifling, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing to the main Queſtion: For whether Anointing gives Poſſeſſion or no, whether <hi>Joaſh</hi> was in Poſſeſſion before or not, is all one in the Preſent Caſe. For if he was out of Poſſeſſion, they put him in Poſſeſſion; if Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was ſo material, they Anointed him; and all this from a ſenſe of their Duty and Allegiance; and ev'n when the Government was actually admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by an Uſurper.<note place="margin">Poſtſcr. p. 9.</note> And then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows (as I ſaid) that Allegiance is due to a Prince, tho his Throne be poſſeſſed by an Uſurper. So that let Anointing give as much Poſſeſſion as the Dr. pleaſe, and let him make what Inferences he thinks good from <hi>Athaliah</hi>'s being ſlain after <hi>Joaſh</hi>'s Anointing, I am not able to ſee what he would prove from them. And if they were granted him, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not from thence prove, that Allegiance is not due to a Rightful Prince diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd, or while an Uſurper is upon his Throne, or that the <hi>Jews</hi> did not pay Allegiance to <hi>Joaſh</hi> before he was anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or at the ſame time that <hi>Athaliah</hi> was on his Throne.</p>
            <p>But the Dr. ſtarts a new Queſtion, and that is, Whether a Private man may kill an Uſurper? and expatiates upon it, and has it in I know not how many places in his Book, tho it be nothing at all to the purpoſe: Perhaps he would have me give ſome Anſwer to that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he can diſpute about it. I can tell him, that Biſhop <hi>Buckeridge,</hi> and other Learned men have aſſerted it: and if he have a mind to it, he may try his faculty, and diſpute the Point againſt them. But I do not know any reaſon, to mix it in the Preſent Controverſie, which is about Submiſſion, and Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Allegiance to Uſurped Powers: And I think there is ſome difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Killing, and Swearing Allegiance to an Uſurper.</p>
            <p>I now come to his Second Anſwer, which relates to his diſtinction of God's Entailing the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> to <hi>David</hi>'s Poſterity, &amp; of other Kingdoms, where Entails are made by Providence; and to this I had given ſeveral Anſwers.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>This Diſtinction is not in the Convocation Book,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Poſtſcr. p. 5. Vindic. p. 24.</note> 
               <hi>and ſo does not affect their ſenſe.</hi> To this the Dr. replies, <hi>I grant it.</hi> And then it ſeems, there may be a fair account given of the Depoſing and Slaying <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaliah,</hi> without having recourſe to the Drs. Diſtinction; for the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation have done that, and the Dr. grants his Diſtinction does not affect their Senſe. But then I would fain know, how it comes to affect the Caſe of <hi>Joaſh</hi> and <hi>Athaliah</hi> ſo much, that it can by no means be ſolv'd without it. I know the Dr. ſays, <hi>he did not concern the Convocation Book in the Story.</hi> But I think that makes no great matter: the Convocation concern'd themſelves in the ſtory; and that may do as well as if the Dr. himſelf had concern'd them in it, and very punctually declare and juſtifie <hi>Jehoiada</hi>'s ſetting up <hi>Joaſh</hi> the Rightful King, and ſlaying <hi>Athaliah</hi> the Uſurper. And that it ſeems may be done without the help of the Drs. Diſtinction; for that does not affect their Senſe. But ſaith he, <hi>tho the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation takes notice of the Story, yet they neither make nor anſwer this Objection</hi> (which the Dr. raiſed from the Story) <hi>in direct terms.</hi> But if the Objection be concerning the Anointing <hi>Joaſh,</hi> and the Depoſing and Slaying <hi>Athaliah,</hi> they had made it ſufficiently; and as for anſwering it <hi>in direct terms,</hi> if by that the Dr. means, they have not anſwer'd it as he hath done, it is true enough; but for all that, they have anſwer'd it <hi>directly</hi> enough; and the whole Chapter and Canon were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107829:26"/> for an Anſwer to it. But ſtill the Dr. tells us, <hi>they had another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in mentioning it, and fitted their anſwers wholly to that, That no Prieſts in the Old Teſtament, did ever De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe from their Crowns, any of their Kings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Convoc. p 41.</note> 
               <hi>how wicked ſoever; or had any Authority ſo to do. And becauſe the Example of</hi> Jehoiada <hi>uſed to be urged by them to this purpoſe, they ſhew that no ſuch thing can be proved from it.</hi> Very well, and ſo they do. And do they not alſo tell us, that <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> ſet up <hi>Joaſh,</hi> and ſlew <hi>Athaliah?</hi> and therefore <hi>tho it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved</hi> (as the Convocation ſays) <hi>that any Prieſts in the Old Teſtament did ever depoſe from their Crowns any of their Kings,</hi> yet it can be proved, that <hi>Jehoiada</hi> reſtor'd the Rightful King, and ſlew the Uſurper. And if the Convocation had been of the Drs. mind, and had thought that an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per now might not be depoſed, and that Subjects did not owe Allegiance to a Rightful King, while his Throne was poſſeſs'd by an Uſurper, it is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that they would not have intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, to prevent the inconveniences that might ariſe from this Example. In other Caſes we ſee how very Nice and Cautious they were, and there was but reaſon. In the Caſe of <hi>Jehu</hi> they ſay,<note place="margin">Convoc. p. 47, 48.</note>

So likewiſe they ſay,<note place="margin">P. 53.</note> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the fact of <hi>Ahud</hi> killing King <hi>Eglon;</hi> and of <hi>Jehu,</hi> 
               <q>Both which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples (being but in number two throughout the Hiſtories of all the Princes, Judges, and Kings, either of <hi>Iſrael</hi> or <hi>Judah</hi>)</q> 
               <hi>it ſeems they thought Athaliah</hi> was none of them, (what a Queen ſoever the Dr. hath made of her) <q>do make it known to us, that altho the Lord may, and is able to overthrow any King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing what miſchiefs private men under colour of thoſe Examples, might have pretended or attempted againſt their Sovereigns, he did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as that it might plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to any (that would not wilfully hoodwink himſelf) never to be lawful for any perſon whatſoever, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of any Revelation, Inſpiration, or Commandment from his Divine Majeſty, either to touch the Perſon of his Sovereign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And this yet more fully and largely inſiſted on in the Canon,<note place="margin">Conyoc. Can. 27. p. 54.</note> which is level'd to prevent the drawing of that fact of <hi>Ahud</hi> into example; and which I beg the Reader to peruſe, and he will ſoon be ſatisfied, how wonderful careful the Convocation was, when any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Examples came in their way, and which were not to be followed in lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ages, to prevent all miſtakes and abuſes, that might by corrupt minds be drawn from them.</p>
            <p>And now let us compare with theſe, the Caſe before us; here is a plain Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Setting up a Rightful King,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107829:27"/> and of Depoſing and Slaying an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and that Example juſtified by the Convocation. Is it poſſible for the Dr. himſelf, or for any man elſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that if the Covocationn had thought that <hi>(in theſe days)</hi> an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ought not to be depoſed, or that men were not bound to pay Allegiance to the Rightful King, when his Throne is in the Poſſeſſion of an Uſurper, that they would not have taken the ſame care in this, as they do in the other Examples, and plainly and clearly have ſaid, that the practice of <hi>Jehoiada</hi> and the People was not <hi>Now</hi> to be drawn into preſident; for certainly, there is not leſs, but a great deal more Reaſon, to believe, that men may think it their duty, to own Allegiance to a diſpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed King, as the People of <hi>Judah</hi> did, than to kill a Lawful King, as <hi>Ahud</hi> did; and to ſeek no further, ſuch a man as Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> being ſo long before he could perſwade himſelf to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is a demonſtrative Evidence of it; and conſequently it required yet the greater Caution to prevent it. But inſtead of that, they ſpeak laudably and commendably of it; and rather give encouragement to it,<note place="margin">Convoc. Can. 23. p. 42.</note> and recommend it, than otherwiſe. <q>If any man ſhall affirm, that it was neither lawful for <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> and the reſt of the Princes, Levites, and People, to have yielded their Subjection to their Lawful King; nor having ſo done, and their King being in Poſſeſſion of his Crown, to have joyned together for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the Uſurper; or that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiada</hi> the High Prieſt, was not bound as he was a Prieſt <hi>(Let the Dr. mind that)</hi> both to inform the Princes, and People, of the Lord's P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And I believe, no good reaſon can be given, why the Convocation ſhould be ſo very expreſs and particular in Cautioning againſt Reſiſting and Killing of Kings, from thoſe other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; and yet give no manner of Caution againſt Depoſing and Killing an Uſurper, from this Example; except they thought <hi>thoſe</hi> were not exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but <hi>this</hi> was. And let any man conſider the Method the Convocation uſes, and he will certainly find, that when ever they mention any Examples, which are not to be drawn into Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in Succeeding Ages, they plainly declare ſo, with all poſſible Induſtry and Caution: And their not doing ſo here, and eſpecially having from this very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample caution'd againſt Depoſing a Rightful King; it is a plain proof, that they did not think, that this Example of <hi>Jehoiada</hi> and the People of <hi>Judah,</hi> was an Example of that kind; but might ſo far as they juſtifie it, be drawn into practice. And this I think (if men
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107829:27"/> are not willfully blind) is a ſufficient evidence, that the Convocation never thought that an Uſurper might not be depos'd, or that Subjects might not p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Dr. indeed hath made ſome difficulty of that, but the Convocation thought of none, they plainly and roundly aſſert it was lawful and their duty ſo to do? The difficulty of the High Prieſts Authority to depoſe a King they obviate, and that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon depos'd was an Uſurper, and what he did was as a Subject, and not as High Prieſt; but they make no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of difficulty, of their <hi>yielding ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to their lawful King,</hi> and then depoſing the Uſurper: And I believe any man that attentively conſiders what the Convocation ſay in this Chapter and Canon, will find that that is the main, if not the only ground of their Anſwer, that becauſe it was lawful, and a duty for Subjects to yield their Subjection and Allegiance to their Lawful King; therefore what <hi>Jehoiada</hi> did in ſetting him up, and depoſing the Uſurper, was not peculiar to his office of High Prieſt, but as a duty in common to him with the reſt of the Subjects; ſo that they are ſo far from diſputing about it, or uſing any Arguments to confirm it, that they take it for granted, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon it, and ground their Anſwer upon the ſuppoſition of it. But ſays the Dr. the Convocation taking notice that Jehoiada <hi>had acquainted them, that it was the Lords will</hi> Joaſh <hi>ſhould reign over them, plainly refers to that Divine Entail.</hi> And this he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to prove more fully in the next page, but to ſave him any further trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I ſhall readily own that when the Convocation ſpeaks of the <hi>Lords will,</hi> and the <hi>Lords purpoſe,</hi> that <hi>Joaſh</hi> ſhould reign, they do refer to that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail upon <hi>David</hi> s Poſterity. And 'tis next to impoſſible to think they ſhould do otherwiſe, for it was by virtue of that very Entail, that <hi>Joaſh</hi> had a Right to the Crown, and had there been no ſuch Entail, <hi>Joaſh</hi> would have had no more Right than <hi>Athaliah</hi> her ſelf; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mentioning of it was proper and neceſſary. It was upon that account that <hi>Joaſh</hi> was their lawful King, and <hi>Athaliah</hi> was an Uſurper. And it was highly reaſonable that <hi>Jehoiada</hi> ſhould ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tifie his proceedings upon it. But what is this to the purpoſe, do they mention this Entail in oppoſition to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Entails? not a word of that: And how then can he ſay, that his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction and anſwer is agreeable to the ſenſe of the Convocation? For they ſpeak it in one ſenſe, and he in another, they ſpeak it without oppoſition to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Entails, and he purely in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them; they urge it, and ſo does
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107829:28"/> 
               <hi>Jehoiada</hi> to juſtifie his proceedings as acting according to the Rule and Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of Right in the Kingdom of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah;</hi> and the Dr. urges it, to prove the unjuſtifiableneſs of acting in the ſame manner in the like caſe in any other Country; at this rate the Dr. if he pleaſe, may prove from the Convocation, that Rebellion and Reſiſtance is lawful in other Countries tho not in <hi>Judah;</hi> for the Convocation refers to Gods Entail when it ſpeaks of the obedience of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Subjects; and therefore accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Dr. Kings that are ſo by Gods Entail, muſt not be reſiſted, but Kings that are ſo by Humane Entails may: And I wonder what reaſon he can give, why the Convocation when they ſpeak of Divine Entails to juſtifie the adhering to the lawful King, and depoſing an Uſurper, is to be underſtood any more in oppoſition to Humane Entails, than when they ſpeak of the very ſame, to juſtifie the Duties of Obedience, and Non-reſiſtance; but the truth is, this is nothing elſe but ſhameleſs fallacy; and howſoever it might look in another, it is not very pardonable in Dr. <hi>Sherlock:</hi> All that the Dr. proves is that, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation and <hi>Jehoiada</hi> himſelf, when they juſtifie his adhering to his Rightful King, and depoſing the Uſurper, refer to the Divine Entail, which was the foundation of the Regal Right in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah;</hi> and upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of which he was the lawful King, and the other an Uſurper. And from hence would make his Reader believe, that they taught that in other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, where the Entails of the Crown are made by Humane Laws; the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ought not to ſtand by the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King, nor depoſe the Uſurper, but ſtand by him and aſſiſt him againſt the Rightful King; which is a wild and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant as well as a ſophiſtical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; and any man but the Dr. would conclude the direct contrary; that becauſe in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> the Subjects were bound to own their diſpoſſeſſed King, and aſſiſt him in the recovery of his Rights, and depoſe an Uſurper that wrongfully poſſeſſed his Throne; becauſe God by Entail had ſix'd and ſetled the Crown in one Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and by that had made the Right to the Government to be in them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in other Countries, becauſe the Laws had entail'd and fix'd the Crown in a certain Family, the Subjects are bound to do the ſame to their Rightful King; For tho the Entails be differing, the Reaſon and Equity of both is the ſame; the King of <hi>Judah</hi> had a Right to the Government by Divine Entail, and the Kings in other Countries by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Entails, but they both have right, and the Laws of doing Right are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and immutable; however the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and determining that Right may be various. And I believe the Dr. is the firſt, that from hence made a negative argument, for tho there have been thoſe who have ſaid, the examples of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Obedience in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do not affect us; becauſe the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Conſtitution of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Commonwealth was differing, but to ſay that, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> were bound to obſerve their Laws of Government, becauſe they were appointed by God himſelf; therefore the Subjects of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Governments are not bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Laws of their reſpective Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, is a ſtrein beyond the Moon, and fit only for the Dr. when he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains paradoxes. Upon the Reſtoration of <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. the Parliament and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom did as <hi>Jehoiada</hi> had done before, they had recourſe to the Laws of the Land, which were the Standard of the Right to the Crown; and they did the ſame upon the Legal Entail, as <hi>Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> did upon the Divine Entail, they eſtabliſh'd the Rightful King and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the Uſurper; and I believe it was never queſtion'd, but they acted as war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably and juſtifiably as <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> tho
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107829:28"/> he did it by virtue of a Divine Entail, and they by virtue of a Humane Entail; but it muſt be confeſſed that the Drs. diſtinction, tho it was then known, yet the corrupt and perverſe uſe of it was never known before, 'till he hath now found it out to ſupport an Hypotheſis every way as abſurd, as the uſe he makes of this diſtinction.</p>
            <p>I had further ſaid with reſpect to the Convocation as the Dr. obſerves, That <hi>they do not ſpeak of this</hi> (the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctio between Divine and Humane Entails) when they call <hi>Athaliah</hi> an Uſurper, and juſtifie the proceedings of <hi>Jehoiada</hi> and the People againſt her; but the Reaſon they give is general, <hi>The Right Heir of the Kingdom being alive, which extends to all Kingdoms that are entail'd and go by Succeſſion.</hi> To this the Dr. replies, <hi>that I make very bold with the Convocation, for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they do not offer to juſtifie the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of</hi> Jehoiada, <hi>and the People againſt</hi> Athaliah, <hi>by ſaying that the Right Heir of the Kingdom was alive, but only prove by that She was an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, who had no Legal Right to the Throne, the Right Heir being liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But if our Author will think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; I preſume he will own that they are two very different queſtions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch a Prince be an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, and whether he may be depoſed and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</hi> In anſwer to this I have only theſe things to obſerve.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That here is one point gained, and that is, that according to the Dr. The ſenſe of the Convocation is, that the Death of the Right Heir makes a <hi>Legal</hi> Right to the Crown to him that Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes it; for he ſays, that they prove from the Right Heirs being living, that <hi>Athaliah</hi> was an Uſurper, and had no <hi>Legal</hi> Right to the Throne, plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that if he had been dead, ſhe had not been an Uſurper, and would have had a <hi>Legal</hi> Right to the Throne; and he tells us that an Uſurper is ſuch a one as hath no <hi>Legal</hi> Right to the Throne. And ſo the Dr. muſt grant me that a <hi>Legal</hi> Right may be conveyed as well by the Death, as by the Ceſſion of the Right Heir. But then all his impertinent diſtinction va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes, when he talks before, of <hi>Legal with reſpect to the Law of nature,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 11.</note> 
               <hi>the Law of nations, and the Laws and Conſtitutions of a particular Nation, and</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in this laſt ſenſe, Legal is underſtood by all men who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand themſelves, in this controverſie of Legal Powers, that thoſe only are Legal Powers, who have the rightful Authority of Government, according to the Laws and Conſtitutions of the Kingdom which they govern:</hi> Now I ſuppoſe the Dr. will take it ill if I ſhould ſay he does <hi>not underſtand himſelf;</hi> and therefore by <hi>Legal</hi> he means <hi>Legal</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Conſtitutions of the Kingdom, then I hope whatever he had ſaid before, he will not now think it ſo great a <hi>blunder</hi> for me to aſſert that a Right to a Government, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd by the Death or Ceſſion of the Right Heir, for we are to ſuppoſe the Dr. <hi>underſtands himſelf,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 11.</note> 
               <hi>and has clear and diſtinct notions of what he writes,</hi> tho he will not allow it to his Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when he ſays the ſame things that he does. But then I doubt half the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of his book will come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; for I had aſſerted that all the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments the Convocation requires and juſtifies obedience to, had acquir'd ſuch a Right; which the Dr. does not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, but falls a diſtinguiſhing between the Laws of Nature, Nations, and a new Law never heard of before; the Law of force, which it ſeems does more than all other Laws, for it cancels the obligation of them all. And then tells me <hi>upon theſe terms he may agree with me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 16.</note> whereas now he hath agreed the point upon my own terms; and ſo hath confuted all that he ſaid before; for if a <hi>Legal</hi> Right to a Government
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107829:29"/> by thoſe means may be acquir'd, if all the Governments the Convocation ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies obedience to, had <hi>ſuch</hi> a Right, if all the Governments they juſtifie the reſiſtance of, had not <hi>ſuch</hi> a Right, then the diſtinction is between Right and no Right, and then by a thorough Settlement, they do mean the acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Legal</hi> Right, and cannot mean uſurped Powers; which (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Dr. himſelf) have no <hi>Legal</hi> Right <hi>(if men underſtand themſelves)</hi> tho perhaps they may have ſomething or other no body knows what, by the Laws of Nature, Nations, or Force.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Dr. ſays, the Convocation does not offer to juſtifie the proceedings of <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> and the People againſt <hi>Athaliah,</hi> by ſaying, that the Right Heir of the Kingdom was alive. Now the Dr. tells me, that becauſe I had ſaid this, I make very bold with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation; and I ſhall leave it with the Reader who makes more bold with the Convocation I that had ſaid they give that as a Reaſon to juſtifie the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or the Dr. who ſays they do not: In this Chapter, after having recited the Uſurpation of <hi>Athaliah,</hi> the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Rightful Prince, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects owning, anointing him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and ſlaying <hi>Athaliah;</hi> add, <q>in all the proceſs of which action, nothing was done, either by <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the High Prieſt, or by the Reſt of the Princes and People of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> which God himſelf did not require at their hands.</q> And to this they add immediatly, Joaſh <hi>their late Kings Son being then their only natural Lord and Sovereign, altho</hi> Athaliah <hi>kept him for ſix years from the Poſſeſſion of his Kingdom.</hi> And if they do not give this as the reaſon of the whole, I wiſh the Dr. would tell me what they give it for. <hi>But</hi> (ſays the Dr.) <hi>they only prove by this, that She was an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, who had no Legal Right to the Throne, the Right Heir being living:</hi> Now it is certain, that this proved her an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; but did not the <hi>Divine Entail</hi> prove her an Uſurper alſo? that ſurely is the direct proof of it, and the ground and reaſon why the other proves it. The ſame Law that declared the Right to be in <hi>Joaſh,</hi> declared <hi>Athaliahs</hi> to be U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation. And why I wonder, ſhould the Right Heirs being living any more declare, that She had no <hi>Legal</hi> Right to the Throne, than the Entail of the Crown did; and when his being alive, and being their natural Prince, declared it ſo only by virtue of that Entail. And I deſire the Dr. to tell me, how <hi>Joaſh</hi>'s being alive prov'd <hi>Athaliah</hi> to be an Uſurper, any otherwiſe than that the Crown of <hi>Judah</hi> was entail'd on <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s poſterity. But then what means this trifling nicety? why truely the Dr. was afraid leaſt his beloved Uſurpation ſhould ſuffer; And therefore adds, that <hi>he believes I will own that they are two very different Queſtions, whether ſuch a Prince be an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, and whether he may be depos'd and murdered;</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered is a very hard word, and I do not care to meddle with it; the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion calls it ſlaying, and I think (with the Drs. leave) there is ſome difference between ſlaying and murdering; and a little more than there is between the Right of an Heir, and the Entail that makes that Right. But to gratifie him I do own, that whether a Prince be an Uſurper, and whether he may be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſlain are two different Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but I ſay likewiſe, that whether an Uſurper may be depoſed and ſlain when the Right Heir is living, is but one Queſtion, and ſuch a Queſtion too, as the Convocation makes no difficulty to anſwer nor any Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Reaſon they all give to juſtifie <hi>Athaliahs</hi> depoſing, was that She was an Uſurper.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall renew my requeſt to the Dr. and deſire him to ſhew me any one approved Author of any Age, that ever aſſerted, that <hi>Tyrannus ſine Titulo</hi> might not be depos'd, or if he cannot do it himſelf, that he will requeſt that learned Pen he tells me of, that is to inform me of the ſenſe of the Primitive Chriſtians; for it is no great credit to this Doctrine, that it hath had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Patrons than <hi>Goodwin, Jenkins,</hi> &amp;c. and only trump'd up to ſerve the vileſt purpoſes; and from that time to this hath not had one ſingle Aſſertor, 'till it is now tranſmigrated to Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had further ſaid, that the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thought of no ſuch difference, but that a thorough Settlement of a Government, (and tho attained by the ſame ill means) was the ſame thing, and had God's Authority in <hi>Judah</hi> as well as any other Nation; as in the inſtances of the <hi>Babylonians, Macedonians,</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> whoſe Government over the <hi>Jews</hi> was not attained by honeſter means than <hi>Athaliahs;</hi> and was as much contrary to the Entail upon <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s houſe, as hers, and yet they juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and require obedience to them, but juſtifie the ſlaying of her; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is plain, that by a thorough Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement they do not mean a full Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Power, [<hi>for</hi> (what the Dr. hath left out) <hi>Athaliah had as full Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Power</hi>] in the Kingdom of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> as had the <hi>Babylonians, Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> or <hi>Romans;</hi> nor do they reckon God's Entail upon <hi>David</hi>'s poſterity any ground of difference in this matter, for the Government of <hi>Judah</hi> by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> was as much contrary to that Entail, as the Government of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaliah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith the Dr.) <hi>all this is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd in one word, The Entail God made upon</hi> David<hi>'s poſterity did always oblige the</hi> Jews, <hi>when they were at their own choice, and had power enough to take the King, on whom God had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd the Crown, which was evidently their caſe, when</hi> Jehoiada <hi>anointed</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſh <hi>and ſlew</hi> Athaliah; <hi>but when they were under force (as they were under the</hi> Babylonians, Macedonians, <hi>and</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans) <hi>no Entail tho made by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could bind them. And then I hope it will be granted, that no Humane Entails can bind any People, who are under force, if a Divine Entail can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, This is no anſwer to the main point; the Queſtion is whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſenſe of the Convocation, a thorough Settlement (by what means ſoever attained) did not oblige the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Judah</hi> to obedience as much as in any other Country; and tho con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Entail on <hi>David</hi>'s poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and it is plain they thought ſo, for they urge the very ſame duties of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Non-reſiſtance to the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> as they do to the Kings of <hi>David</hi>'s Family. The <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> when their Government was throughly ſetled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, their Authority was as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and irreſiſtable as <hi>Joaſh</hi>'s, or any other of their Kings who were ſo by the Divine Entail; and let the Dr. if he can, ſhew me any one duty of Subjects, which they require as due to the Kings of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> by the Divine Entail; which they do not alſo require as equally due to the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> which is clear to a Demonſtration, that they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107829:30"/> thought of no ſuch difference in this matter, but that a thorough Settlement in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> was the ſame thing, and every way as valid as in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Country. And the Inference is plain, that therefore whatever poſſeſſion of Power <hi>Athaliah</hi> had, and whatever ſubmiſſion there was of the People to her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>for that the Dr. is reſolv'd to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) they did not mean that to be the thorough Settlement, which has God's Authority, and to which obedience is due; for they urge obedience and non-reſiſtance to the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> but juſtifie the depoſing and ſlaying of <hi>Athaliah.</hi> But to this (which is the main Queſtion) the Dr. ſays not one word, and all that he ſays is, that <hi>when they were at their own choice and had power, they were bound to take the King on whom God entail'd the Crown, but when they were under force, no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail tho made by God himſelf could bind them.</hi> And what is all this to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation ſpeaking of a thorough Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, without any reſpect to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Divine and Humane Entails? what if the Dr. (to ſave a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anſwer) has found a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>force?</hi> The Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion takes as little notice of this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as it does of the other: But the Dr. hath an extraordinary faculty at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing; when the caſe of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> and <hi>Joaſh</hi> preſſes him, then he is for diſtinguiſhing between <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane</hi> Entails; and <hi>Athaliah</hi> might be depos'd and ſlain, becauſe She was an Uſurper againſt a Divine Entail, and her Government was a <hi>nullity</hi> when the Right Heir appear'd; when he is preſs'd with the inſtances of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> who (according to him) were likewiſe Uſurpers againſt the ſame Divine Entail, then he is for diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>force, when they are at their own choice and have power, they are oblig'd to take the King by God's Entail, when under force God's Entail does not bind them.</hi> So that this laſt diſtinction hath eaten up the former, and the whole matter is reſolved into <hi>force,</hi> if they had power, then the Government of the Uſurper was at an end, and a nullity; and they were bound to proſecute and depoſe the Uſurper: But if they had not Power, the Uſurpers was a very good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ought to be obeyed for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake. And ſo we are furniſhed with admirable meaſures of Obedience and Government, if they have Power they are bound in Conſcience to reſiſt and depoſe, if they are under force they are bound in Conſcience to ſubmit and obey, ſo that either way the Rule of Conſcience is not a Divine Entail, but only force. But then I wonder what the Dr. will ſay to that manifeſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that was between the Uſurpation of <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and the Government of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Romans:</hi> They were plainly under force all the ſix years of <hi>Athaliahs</hi> Uſurpation; and how came it to paſs, that that would not make them Her Subjects, and her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as irreſiſtable as that of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? if force would do it,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 13.</note> why would not <hi>Athaliahs</hi> force effect it as well, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> or the <hi>Roman</hi> force? <hi>Athaliahs force</hi> indeed was the <hi>force</hi> of the Kingdom, and the <hi>Babylonians</hi> was a foreign force; but I ſuppoſe the Dr. does not care to make <hi>that</hi> a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and he expreſly affirms the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>for private Subjects, when the Prince and Government of the Nation is violently changed, and they are under force, force will juſtifie ſubmiſſion, and then it is much the ſame thing from what quarter the force comes.</hi> And why then would not the force coming from <hi>Athaliahs quarter,</hi> do the ſame thing and take off the binding Power of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107829:30"/> the Divine Entail, as well as when it came from the <hi>Babyloniſh quarter?</hi> And why were not they <hi>Athaliahs</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as well as to the Kings of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and her Authority as irreſiſtable? The Nation, the Laws, the Entails, were the ſame, and there was force in one Caſe as well as the other; why tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there was this difference that <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> was an Uſurper, and the Kings of <hi>Babylon</hi> were none. And if the Dr. can find any other difference, he would do well to ſhew it.</p>
            <p>Well! however that be let us ſee what kind of Subjects this Doctrine makes of the <hi>Jews</hi> to the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> He tells us, <hi>Kings ſet up by providence in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi>

               <hi>ſubject to a Divine Entail, may be and are depoſed, whenever the Right Heir appears, though they had all the Rights and Settlement of the Regal Power before:</hi> Now the Doctor owns that the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> were ſet up by Providence over <hi>Judah,</hi> in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Subject to a Divine Entail; and therefore according to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine they might be, and were depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon the appearance of the Right Heir as well as <hi>Athaliah;</hi> I ſpeak it with the Doctor's limitation, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing they had <hi>power enough</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, (for we are not to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Subjects of <hi>Judah</hi> could do more than they had power to do) But then wherein lay that dreadful guilt of Perjury, and Rebellion of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ſo ſeverely taxed and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Scripture? not with reſpect to the <hi>Rights and Settlement</hi> of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar;</hi> for the Doctor tells us Kings ſet up by providence, <hi>may be and are depoſed though they had all the Rights and Settlement of the Regal Power before;</hi> not with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Oath which he had tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor tells us again,<note place="margin">p. 37.</note> that <hi>no Oath can oblige againſt a Divine Entai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>;</hi> and therefore it was only for the want of Power, and the dreadful account the Scripture gives us of the Perjury and Rebellion of <hi>Zedekiah;</hi> and which was followed with ſuch a remarkable vengeance; and likewiſe thoſe frequent Rebellions of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that <hi>Phariſaical</hi> ſpirit of Rebellion ſo juſtly taxed by the Convocation, and by the Doctor too (though ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly applied) it ſeems the only fault and guilt of them was, their fooliſh attempting without ſufficent Power, for if they had <hi>power enough</hi> they might not only lawfully but they were bound to do it; for he tells us elſewhere,<note place="margin">p. 41.</note> 
               <hi>though God may ſee fit ſometimes to ſet a Providential King upon the Throne, yet whenever he nominates a new King, or diſcovers the Right Heir to whom the Crown belongs by a Divine Entail; the Reign of ſuch Providential Kings is at an end, and the Subjects may and</hi> ought <hi>to depoſe and kill them;</hi> That is as he ſays before,<note place="margin">p. 36.</note> 
               <hi>whenever God is pleaſed to put it into their Power to place him</hi> (the Right Heir) <hi>on the Throne;</hi> ſo that it ſeems the Jews were rare Subjects all this while, and this an admirable Scheme of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, may men ſwear Allegiance to a Prince, and tye themſelves to him by all the ſacred Bonds poſſible, and then ſo ſoon as they have Power, depoſe and kill him? nay are as much bound in Conſcience, to kill him when they have Power, as they were to ſwear to him when they had none; which is an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry account of Fidelity and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and very fit for an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Hypotheſis.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:107829:31"/>
            <p>But here the Dr. is hard put to it, and wofully contradicts himſelf; in the Caſe of <hi>Athaliah</hi> the Divine Entail is ſet up, and is to anſwer all Arguments; and then <hi>when the Right Heir appears the Reign of ſuch provid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 41.</note> 
               <hi>and the Subjects may and</hi> ought <hi>to depoſe and kill them:</hi> And he ſays it yet further with this Circumſtance,<note place="margin">P. 35.</note> tho <hi>they had all the Rights and Settlement of the Regal power before,</hi> &amp;c. So that in that Caſe neither <hi>Rights</hi> nor <hi>Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> nor any thing elſe, is valid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Divine Entail, but the Uſurper is to be depoſed and killed. But now in the Caſe of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> (the Drs. Uſurpers too, to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes as much as <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and a little more; for according to him, they were U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers both againſt a Divine Law, and a Divine Entail) <hi>force</hi> is to do the buſineſs, and the Divine Entail it ſelf ſignifies nothing at all, nor is of any validity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that. For ſays he, <hi>when they were under force, (as they were under the</hi> Babylonians,<note place="margin">P. 27.</note> Macedonians, <hi>and</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans) <hi>no Entail, tho made by God himſelf could bind them.</hi> I have but one thing more to add, that this again is as flat a contradiction, and in expreſs terms to what he ſays in his <hi>Caſe of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance</hi> as ever I met with: For he tells us upon this very matter,<note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg. p. 21.</note> 
               <hi>That the Prophet</hi> Jeremy's <hi>argument is propheſie, or an expreſs command from God to ſubmit to the King of</hi> Babylon; <hi>and there was great Reaſon for an expreſs command from God at that time,</hi> and I pray obſerve his reaſon: <hi>Becauſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had entail'd the Kingdom on</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid<hi>'s Poſterity, and therefore without an expreſs command from God, they could not ſubject themſelves to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince, while any of that Family were living.</hi> So that it ſeems, <hi>then</hi> force nor any thing elſe would juſtifie their ſubmiſſion without an <hi>expreſs</hi> command, but the Drs. buſineſs now is to anſwer objections, and if that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done without contradicting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who can help it, that is the fault of the objection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. My ſecond Reaſon againſt the uſe the Dr. makes of his diſtinction was,<note place="margin">Anſw. p. 5.</note> that the Drs. Arguments will equally juſtifie ſubmiſſion to <hi>Athaliah</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> notwithſtanding ſuch Entail as to any Uſurper in any other Nation.</p>
            <p>To this the Dr. replies, <hi>Well? and ſuppoſe he can prove it, what then?</hi> why then I have proved what I intended to prove, and that is, that the uſe the Dr. makes of this diſtinction in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe is impertinent and trifling, as we ſhall ſee preſently; But ſaith the Dr. <hi>Did I ever deny, that it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to ſubmit to</hi> Athaliah <hi>while She was poſſeſſed of the Throne, and the true Heir concealed?</hi> Now I do not know what the Dr. means by <hi>denying,</hi> perhaps he may have ſome diſtinction in reſerve to ſalve the buſineſs, and if he have let us ſee it, in the mean time he hath expreſly affirm'd the contrary, and that I think is denying it. In his Caſe of Allegiance, he tells us, <hi>that God himſelf had entail'd the Kingdom of</hi> Judah;<note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg. p. 35.</note> 
               <hi>and therefore nothing could juſtifie their ſubmiſſion to an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, when the Kings Son was found;</hi> and he further ſays in the ſame place, <hi>that Subjects are bound to adhere to their Prince of Gods chuſing when he is known, and to perſecute all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers to the utmoſt, and</hi> never <hi>ſubmit to their Government.</hi> And this I think is denying it with a witneſs, for if <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> could juſtifie their ſubmiſſion to an Uſurper, and if they were bound <hi>never</hi> to ſubmit to their Government, then I think it is plain enough, that it was not lawful for them to ſubmit to <hi>Athaliah,</hi> while She was poſſeſſed of the Throne. The Drs. limitation here, <hi>and the true Heir conceal'd,</hi> and <hi>when
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107829:31"/> the Kings Son was found,</hi> and <hi>when the Right Heir was known</hi> ſignifies nothing, for he plainly ſays here, <hi>If any one ſhould be condemn'd for it,</hi> Jehoiada <hi>was the man, who</hi> knew <hi>that</hi> Joaſh <hi>was living; and yet for ſix years together while he thought fit to conceal the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, he ſubmitted himſelf to</hi> Athaliah, <hi>and acted under her Authority, and neither blames himſelf, nor any of the Nation for doing ſo:</hi> Now I hope, that <hi>when the Kings Son was found, and when the Right Heir was known,</hi> what force ſoever it might have with reſpect to the reſt of the Subjects, it could have none with reſpect to <hi>Jehoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada,</hi> (for he that hid him need not be told where to find him;) And then it follows if nothing would juſtifie their ſubmiſſion to an Uſurper, when the Kings Son was found, then <hi>nothing</hi> would juſtifie the ſubmiſſion of <hi>Jehoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada</hi> to <hi>Athaliah;</hi> if Subjects when the Prince of God's chuſing was known, were bound <hi>never</hi> to ſubmit to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers Government, then <hi>Jehoiada</hi> who knew that Prince, was bound ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſubmit to <hi>Athaliah,</hi> but then what becomes of the ſubmiſſion that he now talks on, and in the next Page ſays <hi>it is certain they ought to be juſtified in it,</hi> i. e. it is <hi>certain</hi> the Dr. contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himſelf; for that nothing can <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie</hi> ſubmiſſion, and they ought to be <hi>juſtified</hi> in their ſubmiſſion, is as flat a contradiction as words can make. But the Dr. had forgot what he ſaid before, and who can help that.<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 79.</note> But methinks he that is more afraid of other mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions than their memories, may a little fear his own memory, and not ſay he never deny'd that, which he hath flatly deny'd, in the preſent controverſie, and in the preſent caſe.</p>
            <p>But ſaith the Dr. <hi>Does he find in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that the</hi> Jews <hi>are condemn'd for ſubmitting all this while to</hi> Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah? No truly I do not find it, and does the Dr. find in Scripture, that they did ſubmit to her, ſo as to become her Subjects? When the Dr. finds that, it is time enough for me to find the other, and that I ſuppoſe will be a good while firſt; but tho it is not to be found in Scripture, I can tell him where he may find it, and that is in <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and as far as I know he will be hard put to it to find it any where beſides. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> indeed ſays it, but with a little more modeſty than the Doctor He does not ſay they did ſubmit,<note place="margin">Credibile eſt p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>What is it that the Doctor would have me to do? Would he have me prove this according to <hi>his</hi> Principles? I beg his pardon for that, except I was better aſſur'd what his Principles are: about this very matter he hath one Principle in his <hi>Caſe of Reſiſtance,</hi> another in his <hi>Caſe of Allegiance,</hi> and another in his <hi>Vindication of that caſe,</hi> and perhaps he may have yet another in his next book; and would he have me prove things by Prophecy? How can I divine what his Principles are, or will be? nor perhaps he himſelf: it is enough in all Conſcience that I have prov'd that his Arguments equally ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie ſubmiſſion to <hi>Athaliah</hi> as to any Uſurper, according to what he hath deliver'd in his Caſe of Alleg. tho I do not prove it according to various and changeable Principles, which are one thing to day, and another to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.

            <p>I had inſiſted upon two, His Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Providence, and from the neceſſity of Government for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of humane Society.</p>

                  </gap>ree, Order, and peculiar Order. Well,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I muſt own it, for I know none but God who can advance to the Throne, and I know no more hurt in owning that God exalted</hi> Athaliah <hi>to the Throne, than that he exalted</hi> Baaſha <hi>who ſlew</hi> Nadab <hi>the ſon of</hi> Jeroboam <hi>and reigned in his ſtead; and God by his Prophet tells</hi> Baaſha, <hi>I exalted thee out of the duſt, and made thee Prince over my People Iſrael,</hi> 1 King. 16.2. But tho the Doctor knows no more <hi>hurt</hi> in it, I hope he knows, there is a great deal of difference, for <hi>Baaſha</hi> was a rightful King, and no Uſurper, and <hi>Athaliah</hi> was an Uſurper, and no rightful Queen, and (if the Doctor pleaſe) no Queen at all. A very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent compariſon! The Queſtion is concerning an Uſurper, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor proves it by an inſtance of a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King; as if, Becauſe it is ſaid of <hi>Baaſha</hi> who was a rightful King, that God exalted him, and made him a Prince over his People; therefore <hi>Athaliah</hi> and every other Uſurper if by God's Providence they can get poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Throne, God makes Kings and Queens of them too. An admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable conſequence! The Scripture af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107829:32"/> of a rightful King, that God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted and made him a Prince, and the Doctor affirms the ſame of an Uſurper, tho the Scripture ſays no ſuch thing of <hi>Athaliah,</hi> or any other Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. God permitted them to be Uſurpers, but he never made them Kings or Queens; and if God had made <hi>Athaliah</hi> a Queen, I wonder how the right Heir and the People ſhould unmake her again? If God gave her his Authority, which way ſhould the People take it away again. But as inconſequent as this is, the Doctor has it over and over, pag. 50. He ſays <hi>Athaliah</hi> was God's providential Queen tho an Uſurper, as much as <hi>Baaſha</hi> was God's King. And how does he prove it? why God himſelf by his Prophet ſays the one, and the Doctor ſays the other.</p>
            <p>This ſingle inſtance, if men would conſider it without prejudice and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, would be ſufficient to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Controverſie. <hi>Baaſha</hi> rais'd himſelf to the Throne of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by as ill means as <hi>Athaliah</hi> uſurp'd the Throne of <hi>Judah.</hi> But <hi>Baaſha</hi> was a rightful King and ought to have been obey'd, and <hi>Athaliah</hi> was an Uſurper and ought to have been depos'd; and the reaſon of this difference is manifeſt, becauſe the Crown of <hi>Judah</hi> was entail'd, but the Crown of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was not, and the poſſeſſion of the Throne by <hi>Athaliah</hi> was in prejudice of the right Heir, but the Poſſeſſion by <hi>Baaſha</hi> in <hi>Iſrael</hi> was not, for no perſon had a better right to it than himſelf. And this is a plain Anſwer to that tedious Account the Doctor gives in the two next Pages of the difference between the Kingdoms of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the diviſion of the ten Tribes; whereas the plain difference is, that the one was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary and not the other; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Iſrael</hi> poſſeſſion of the Crown gave a Right to it, for there was no better Right againſt it, but in <hi>Judah</hi> it did not; and this ſeems the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Convocation mention'd <hi>the right Heir of that Kingdom being then living,</hi> i. e. there was a plain and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Right in being againſt the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, and which they were bound to own and ſtand by what poſſeſſion ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever an Uſurper h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And this is a ſufficient Anſwer to what he ſays in the next pages: but there is one thing more deſerves to be taken notice of, and that is the Reaſon he gives of the different behaviour of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Jehu</hi> becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> was a King by God's nomination, and <hi>Joram</hi> only a providential King.

I know the Doctor ſays, that <hi>when God nominated any King, it was always for life,</hi> but that is ſaid without proof, for where does he find ſuch a Clauſe in the gift, that they ſhould be Kings during life. But the true Reaſon of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent behaviour of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jehu</hi> was not becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> was an anointed King, and <hi>Joram</hi> a providential King, nor yet from their being both anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the Doctor may find that long

               <note place="margin">2 Kin. 9.</note> 
               <hi>I have anoinied thee King over Iſrael, and thou ſhalt ſmite the houſe of</hi> Ahab <hi>thy Maſter,</hi> &amp;c. So that together with his nomination, and anointing at that time, he had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God, and which he was immediately to put in execution, and God gave him accordingly Power and Authority to fulfill it: but not the leaſt intimation of the Doctor's fancy, becauſe <hi>Joram was a providential King,</hi> or becauſe a <hi>providential Right in the Kingdom of</hi> Iſrael <hi>was to give place to God's anointing;</hi> for whatever Right there was in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> or any other Kingdom, it was to give place to that. But if men, without any warrant from the Text, and of their own heads, will be framing Schemes from Scripture to ſerve a wretched Hypotheſis, it is no great wonder if humane Writings, ſuch as the <hi>Convocation Book,</hi> do not eſcape their corrupt Interpretations, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of it to ſerve the ſame end. But to return,</p>
            <p>The Doctor adds, <hi>And what does he prove from this?</hi> That according to the Doctor's Principles <hi>Athaliah</hi> was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Throne by God, by his Council, Decree, Order, and peculiar Order: That is what I prove. <q>Now <hi>Athaliah</hi> (ſays he) had the actual adminiſtra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>To this the Doctor replies, <hi>Grant all this, and what then?</hi> Why then the Doctor's Arguments are loſt by his own confeſſion; for but fifteen lines before he ſays, that I ſay his Arguments will equally ſerve <hi>Athaliah</hi> as any other King or Queen <hi>de facto,</hi> and he ſays, <hi>if they will, he will give them up for loſt.</hi> But ſays he, <hi>Why then this juſtifies tht ſubmiſſion of the</hi> Jews <hi>to</hi> Athaliah <hi>while ſhe was poſſeſs'd of the Throne and no right Heir appear'd. But if he would have concluded any thing to the purpoſe, he ſhould have ſaid, And therefore it was unlawful for</hi> Jehoiada <hi>to have anointed</hi> Joaſh, <hi>and to have killed</hi> Athaliah. But what need was there for me to have concluded that?

               <hi>Had our Author con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd this he would not have ſaid, that 'tis mere trifling to talk of God's entail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Crown, as if God was tyed any more,</hi> &amp;c.

And I cannot very well ſee what more he can make of <hi>expreſs Revelations.</hi> The manner of notifying it indeed is not the ſame, but God's Will is the ſame, is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and ought to be comply'd with as much as if it had been expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd.<note place="margin">Poſtſcript p. 6.</note> And this I had ſaid, <hi>If the Poſſeſſion of the Throne by Providence be a clear and demonſtrative Evidence that ſuch a Perſon hath God's Authority, and that God would have him obey'd as King then it is ſo notwithſtanding any Entail made by himſelf.</hi> There is a difference between divine and humane Entails, but the Queſtion is, Whether God's Orders are not as valid againſt his own Entails, as well as againſt humane Entails? And when there is a plain manifeſtation of his Will, it does not as well ſuperſede the Rules made by himſelf, as ſet aſide thoſe made by men? And here I ſhall reſt it; If the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Throne by Providence be a demonſtrative Evidence that God hath given the Crown to ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that it is God's will he ſhould be own'd and obey'd as a King of his making, then it is ſo notwithſtanding any Entail made by himſelf; if it be not ſuch an Evidence, then it is not ſo notwithſtanding humane Entails.</p>
            <p>But there is one thing more I had mention'd from the Doctor which he hath here omitted, and I ſuppoſe for ſome good reaſon or other: from his Doctrine of Providence he had laid down this as one Propoſition, That <hi>all Kings are equally rightful with reſpect to God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg. p. 14.</note> 
               <hi>for thoſe are all rightful Kings who are placed in the Throne by God, and it is impoſſible there ſhould be a wrong King, unleſs a man could make himſelf King whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God will or no.</hi> This I had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>If all Kings, then ſurely</hi> Athaliah <hi>among the reſt,</hi> and <hi>I only ſuppos'd that</hi> Athaliah <hi>could not do what was impoſſible, nor (if ſhe had never ſo much mind to it) could ſhe make her ſelf Queen whether God would or no.</hi> But I add, then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that <hi>Athaliah</hi> was a rightful Queen with reſpect to God, nay ſhe was as equally rightful with reſpect to him as <hi>Joaſh</hi> himſelf, or as <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Solomon,</hi> for he ſays, <hi>That all Kings are equally rightful with reſpect to God.</hi> But then I wonder how <hi>Athaliah</hi> who was a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Queen with reſpect to God, ſhould be otherwiſe with reſpect to God's En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail, or that ſhe who was rightful Queen with reſpect to God, might juſtly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and ſlain, with reſpect to his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail. But the Dr. did not think fit to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107829:35"/> take notice of the mention I made of this Propoſition, and I ſuppoſe by this time the Reader is ſatisfied of the reaſon.</p>
            <p>But (ſays the Doctor) <hi>This he knew did not follow from my Principles,</hi> i. e. the Doctor did not ſay <hi>it was unlawful for</hi> Jehoiada <hi>to have anointed</hi> Joaſh <hi>and to have killed</hi> Athaliah. And it would be pretty ſtrange if he ſhould. But this follows from his Arguments; and that is enough to ſhew their faultineſs. But I pray mark his Reaſon; <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I expreſly diſtinguiſh between Gods making Kings by a particular nomination as he made Kings in</hi> Jewry, <hi>and entail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Kingdom of</hi> Judah <hi>on</hi> David's <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, and his making Kings by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as he does in other Nations;</hi> that is to ſay, the Doctor defends his Diſtinction by his Diſtinction. I was here arguing againſt the uſe he made of his Diſtinction, and he tells me he expreſly diſtinguiſhes ſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it did not follow from his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Very logically anſwer'd!</p>
            <p>The next Argument I had menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd of the Doctor's, and which he ſays,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 36.</note> 
               <hi>There will be no great occaſion to take notice of,</hi> was <hi>from the neceſſity of Government to the preſervation of humane Society; for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I readily grant what he contends for, That theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will equally conclude for ſubmiſſion to</hi> Athaliah <hi>as to any other Uſurper.</hi> Well! that is as much as I can deſire; and then, if I miſtake not, he muſt grant too, that his Diſtinction is fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous and his Arguments weak, and not concluding: for what Submiſſion is that which the Preſervation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Societies will juſtifie to be paid to an Uſurper? why truly according to him a full and entire Submiſſion, the very ſame to all intents and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that is due to the moſt rightful Prince in the World. <hi>For Biſhop San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caſe of All. p. 38.</note> 
               <hi>and the zealous Loyaliſts</hi> (as he ſays) <hi>own it lawful for Subjects to pay ſome kind of ſubmiſſion and complyance to uſurped Powers, but not to own their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> But this will not ſatisfie the Doctor, and therefore in Anſwer to Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi> he tells us plainly, <hi>That nothing can preſerve Society, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Authority in the Uſurper and Duty in the Subject. And if humane Societies muſt be preſerved, then the neceſſities of Government give Authority to the Prince, and lay an obligation of duty on the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: if God will preſerve humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we muſt conclude, that when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves one King out of the Throne, he gives his Authority to him whom he places there.</hi> i. e. He took it away from <hi>Joaſh</hi> and gave it to <hi>Athaliah.</hi> For if <hi>we</hi> muſt conclude ſo from the neceſſity of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to preſerve humane Society, I wonder why the <hi>Jews</hi> (upon the ſame Reaſon) were not to conclude ſo as well as we; and then it concludes too much, and that is, it concludes that the Doctor's Argument is naught. But the Doctor goes a little further, and ſays he,<note place="margin">Caſe of All. p. 39.</note> 
               <hi>I would ask whether the care of my own preſervation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>does ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me in conſcience to obey and ſubmit to the Government, and the Prince who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, and to wiſh and pray for, and do my utmoſt to endeavour their Proſperity? if it does, I ſee no difference between this and Alleg. and what I am bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to do, I may ſwear to do: if it does not, then I am at liberty to diſturb the Government notwithſtanding all my gratitude when I can, nay am under an Obligation by my Alleg. to the diſpoſſeſſed Prince, to do it when I can. And how does this contribute to the ſafety and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of humane Societies.</hi> This is pretty well; and if it was but true one would have thought <hi>Athaliah</hi> as well eſtabliſh'd in the Allegiance of the Subjects as any Prince in the World, and a little better than <hi>Joaſh</hi> himſelf. But the Doctor hath yet one ſtep fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">P. 40</note>

But if he would have taken it all together, he might eaſily (had he ſo pleas'd) have ſeen another ſenſe in it.

If it did, then his diſtinction is in vain; if not, then his Argument is in vain. For I had ſaid, and which the Dr. does not diſprove,<note place="margin">Poſtſcr. p. 8.</note> that <hi>theſe are arguments from the nature of the thing, which are equally the ſame in all Governments: for the ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are the ſame in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys; and ſelf-preſervation, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Society, and the neceſſity of Government, in order to it, theſe are the ſame with reſpect to</hi> Judah, <hi>as to any other Society.</hi> The Ends of Government, and the Conſervation of Humane Socieyt, will juſtifie as much and no more in one Kingdom, than in another; what they would juſtifie in <hi>England,</hi> that they would juſtifie in <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>è contra.</hi> The Queſtion is no more but this, Will the neceſſity of Government for the Preſervation of Humane Society, juſtifie ſuch a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion as the Dr. contends for, or will it not? If it will, then it would juſtifie ſuch an intire ſubmiſſion to <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and then the depoſing her, was Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Rebellion: If it will not, then it will not juſtifie ſuch a Submiſſion in any other Country. And here I muſt reſt it, till the Dr. thinks fit to give an Anſwer to it:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">P. 36.</note>But the Dr. ſays, <hi>the</hi> Jews <hi>did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſubmit to</hi> Athaliah: what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in the ſenſe the Dr. contends for, to become her Subjects, to own her Authority, to ſubmit to her as a Queen of God's ſending and making: This I doubt, the Subjects of Conſcience did not, tho I believe alſo, there were a great many others of them that did. The Dr. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſays, <hi>it is evident from the ſtory they did.</hi> But what ſtory does he mean? The Scripture account, as far as I can find, intimates no ſuch thing: and the Dr. in his next will do well to tell us, what ſtory he means. But the Dr. here lays great weight upon the Subjects not knowing that <hi>Joaſh</hi> was living, and takes ſome pains to prove it. <hi>As if (ſaith he) they could not very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently and lawfully ſubmit to the Government of</hi> Athaliah, <hi>while they knew of no other King they had:</hi> and ſays, that <hi>my ſuppoſing the</hi> Jews <hi>knew it was my fundamental mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,</hi> &amp;c.

If therefore their Submiſſion was (as the Dr. aſſerts) innocent and lawful, it muſt be upon my Principles, and not upon his: He who they thought the Right Heir, had him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſubmitted, and that juſtified their Submiſſion; ſuppoſing ſtill that they did ſubmit: for that the Dr. has not proved.

The matter is, whether the <hi>Jews</hi> might become Subjects to <hi>Athaliah,</hi> while <hi>Joaſh</hi> was living: the Dr. places a great deal, in his being conceal'd; and ſays, they might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do it, when he was hid: and then to make me ſay ſo too, asks me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by my own Principles, they might not have done it, if they believ'd the <hi>whole Line was extinct?</hi> A very grave Queſtion, and much to the purpoſe! Well, I ſee there is no dealing with ſuch a Diſputer, that will make ſuch turns upon his Adverſaries. I had thought there had been ſome difference between Poſſeſſion againſt a Right, and Poſſeſſion when there was no better Right. And I deſire to know of the Dr. why they ought to have ſubmitted to <hi>Athaliah,</hi> or innocently might. The Concealment of <hi>Joaſh</hi> will not ſerve the turn, except the whole Family of <hi>David</hi> had been conceal'd likewiſe; and the Dr. I doubt, will be as little able to make that <hi>evident from the ſtory,</hi> as that <hi>Jehoiada</hi> and the People ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>The Dr. tells us,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 37.</note> he <hi>aſſerted in the Caſe, that Government and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance are ſuch Relatives, as do</hi> mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuo ſe ponere &amp; tollere, <hi>the one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt without the other; if the Prince can't govern, the Subject can't obey.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Poſtſcr. p. 9.</note> To this I had made a ſhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, which the Dr. does not think fit to take notice of: <hi>And therefore becauſe they can't obey him, they muſt fight againſt him, and kill him, and do their utmoſt to ruine him.</hi> And yet I conceive, there is ſome difference between actual obedience, and actual hoſtility. And I wonder where is the Conſequence; A King is hindred from actually governing his people; and therefore the people are bound to do their utmoſt to hinder him ſtill, or to knock him on the head. For, ſays the Dr. <hi>And therefore as far as he quits his Government, he quits their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, and leaves his Subjects as he does his Crown, to be poſſeſſed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and muſt recover them both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi> Now (ſay he) <hi>This the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſays, is as plain a fallacy, as ever he met with; and proves from the example of</hi> Joaſh, <hi>that it is ſo.</hi> But here the Dr. does not repeat fairly his own words nor mine: For tho I had ſaid it was a plain fallacy, yet it was not only with reſpect to thoſe words of his which he hath repeated, but to the whole; and more eſpecially to that which follows, and which he hath omitted: for he adds in the Caſe of Allegiance, <hi>He may have a Legal Right to both, but he cannot actually have
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107829:37"/> the Subjects Allegiance without the Crown; nor can the Subjects pay him their Allegiance, without his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtored to poſſeſſion of the Throne, no more than they can obey, when he cannot command.</hi> Theſe I ſuppoſe, the Dr. did not add as ſuperfluous words, but deſign'd by them either more fully to explain his meaning, or to prove his Aſſertion; and to theſe my Anſwer was more immediately ſuited; at the foot of theſe to wind up his Argument, the Dr. ſays, <hi>this is as certain as any Propoſition in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.</hi> My Anſwer was, <hi>it is as plain a fallacy as ever I met with; and the inſtance before us</hi> (of <hi>Joaſh) lays it open.</hi> The Dr. replys, <hi>but I have ſaid ſo much already to that Caſe, that I will trouble my Reader no further with it.</hi> A ſpecial Reply: and let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der judge of it. I ſaid, <hi>I ask the Dr. was the reſtoring</hi> Joaſh <hi>to the Throne, an act of their Allegiance or no? If not, what duty was it? But if it was, then Allegiance follows the Perſon of the King, tho he be out of the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Throne.</hi> And this is as direct againſt the Drs. Aſſertion as any thing can be: for if the Reſtoring <hi>Joaſh</hi> to the Poſſeſſion of his Throne when he was out of Poſſeſſion, was an act of their Allegiance to him, then a Prince <hi>may actually have the Subjects Allegiance, and they may</hi> (nay, they ought) <hi>to pay him Allegiance without</hi> (if before be without) <hi>his being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to the poſſeſſion of his Throne.</hi> But forſooth the Dr. did not think fit <hi>to trouble himſelf, nor his Readers with an anſwer to it.</hi> And I cannot blame him; for why ſhould a man trouble his Readers with any thing, when he hath nothing to ſay to it? It is a wiſe way to ſcorn an Argument, which we cannot anſwer. But to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie him, what does he think of the Caſe of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second? I hope he may vouchſafe to trouble his Readers with an Anſwer to that, tho he does not to the Caſe of <hi>Joaſh:</hi> was the reſtoring him to the Poſſeſſion of his Throne, an Act of the Subjects Allegiance, or was it not? If not, the Dr. will be very kind to tell us what it was ſome civility perhaps or kindneſs; to him and his family, but no act of duty. And ſo the Parliamentary Acts of Recognition, and owning him King all the time of his abſence, and the <hi>Act of Indemnity, &amp;c.</hi> are meer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements of State, but in reality, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all: For <hi>he quitted the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance of the Subjects, when he quitted the poſſeſſion of the Throne,</hi> and they ow'd him no Allegiance, nor could they pay him any, 'till he was reſtor'd to the poſſeſſion: And beſide, the Dr. hath told us,<note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg. p 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </note> that <hi>there is a vaſt difference between maintaining and defending a Regnant Prince, and reſtoring a diſpoſſeſſed Prince.</hi> But now, if the Reſtoring him, was an Act of their Allegiance, then Allegiance is due to the Perſon of the King, when he is out of the Poſſeſſion of the Throne, and they are bound to pay it to him, before he is poſſeſſed of it. And when the Dr. thinks fit to <hi>trouble his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> he may anſwer it: and if he does not think fit to anſwer me, let him anſwer the Acts of Parliament, and the Juſtice of the Nation. And his fine buſineſs <hi>of Divine and Humane En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails, giving very different Rights to Princes</hi> will ſignifie nothing here: For King <hi>Charles</hi> was King, not by <hi>Divine,</hi> but by <hi>Humane Entail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dr. proceeds upon my Anſwer, and ſays that I ſay, <hi>By Government, he means, the Actual Adminiſtration of it; and then Government and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance are ſo far from being</hi> ſuch <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives, that they are no Relatives at all; they are only the Acts of Relatives, and to ſay the Acts of Relatives are Relatives, is ſo far from being as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as any Propoſition in Logic, that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107829:38"/> it is Logical Nonſenſe.</hi> To this the Dr. replys, <hi>Well! Logical Nonſenſe I hope is the beſt ſort of Nonſenſe how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi> Well! Beſt or worſt, <hi>Nonſenſe</hi> it is; and if the Dr. had rather have it of the beſt ſort, with all my heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>my meaning is plain enough, and certainly true; which is as much, as any Propoſition in Logick can be. By Government, I do mean the Actual Adminiſtration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not as that ſignifies the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Acts of Government, but the Actual Poſſeſſion of Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Govern. By Allegiance, I mean that Obedience and Subjection that is due to Government.</hi> Something is the matter ſure, that we muſt diſtinguiſh ſo nicely. I wonder what is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Actual Poſſeſſion of Power, and Actual adminiſtring it: And if there was any difference, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he means now, in his <hi>Caſe of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,</hi> he certainly meant the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring, <hi>i. e.</hi> the performing the Acts of Government: for his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is,<note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg. p. 42.</note> 
               <hi>If the Prince cannot govern, the Subject can't obey.</hi> And what does he mean by the Prince cannot go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, but that he cannot perform the Acts of Government, cannot exerciſe and adminiſter it. And the ſame he means with reſpect to the Allegiance of the Subject.<note place="margin">P. 43.</note> 
               <hi>The Subject cannot obey: i. e.</hi> cannot actually pay his Allegiance. And this he muſt mean, if he means any thing: And ſo he ſays after, <hi>He may have a Legal Right, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not actually have the Subjects Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, nor can Subjects pay him their Allegiance; i. e.</hi> cannot perform the Acts of it. I know there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Acts of Allegiance, and the Duty of Allegiance. A man may owe Allegiance, where he cannot pay it; and it may be <hi>due</hi> to a Perſon, to whom the Subject cannot perform the Acts of it. But this is ſo far from doing him ſervice, that it confutes his whole Argument: for what <hi>if when the Prince can't govern, the Subjects can't obey;</hi> yet if the Subject may <hi>owe</hi> the Prince Obedience, what if the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject cannot pay the Prince Allegiance; yet if Allegiance be <hi>due</hi> to him, the Drs. Argument falls. And what then makes him diſtinguiſh thus Critically? Why truly, I had ſaid, <hi>That the Actual adminiſtration of Government and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance are not Relatives, but the Acts of Relatives.</hi> And to be even with me, By Actual Adminiſtration, he does not mean the particular <hi>Acts</hi> of Government, and by Allegiance the Duty, and not the particular Acts of it: And what is this to the purpoſe? Are they not the Acts of Relatives, for all that? What if <hi>Actual Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,</hi> ſhould ſignifie <hi>Actual Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſeſſion and Authority;</hi> is it not an <hi>Act</hi> of the Relative, when it ſignifies ſo, as well as when it ſignifies particular Acts of Government? What if Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance means that <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which is due to Government,</hi> is not that an <hi>Act</hi> of the Relative, as well as when it means the particular Acts of Allegiance? Actual Authority is not the particular Acts of Government, but it is the Act of the Relative: the Duty of Allegiance, is not the particular Acts of Allegiance, but it is the Act of the Relative. And therefore let the Dr. mean what he pleaſe by them, it makes no Alteration in the Caſe. For either way they are Acts of Relatives, and therefore not Relatives themſelves. And this is the Single Queſtion, and I ask him, <hi>If the Actual Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government ſignifies Poſſeſſion of Power and Authority to Govern, and Allegiance means that Obedience and Subjection which is due to Goverment,</hi> are they then Relatives? Why truly the Dr. cannot ſay that, tho he hath a great mind to it, but ſays, <hi>if the Author will be ſo ſevere, as not to allow me to call theſe Relatives.</hi> But the Dr. is miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107829:38"/> if he thinks I contend with him only about a meer propriety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: For the whole ſtreſs of the Argument depends upon it. And if the Dr. miſtakes the uſe of an Expreſſion; and argues and builds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch miſtake, there is no reaſon to give up the Argument, out of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Expreſſion. Relatives <hi>ſe mutuo ponunt &amp; tollunt.</hi> But if the Actual Adminiſtration of Government and Allegiance, are not <hi>Relatives,</hi> then they do not <hi>ſe mutuo ponere &amp; tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lore,</hi> which the Dr. concludes from their being Relatives. And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he would have me give him out of good manners, for he hath not prov'd it, nor does he now directly aſſert it: But (ſaith he) <hi>they are the Relations which make the Relatives, and do</hi> mutuo ſe ponere &amp; tollere. Now if the Dr. can prove, that Actual Poſſeſſion of Power, is the Relation that makes a King; or if he can prove, that the Actual Poſſeſſion of Power (he adds indeed and <hi>Authority to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern;</hi> but if he means by that, more than Poſſeſſion of Power, he ſpeaks ambiguouſly, and ought to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd himſelf) and the Allegiance of the Subject do <hi>mutuo ſe ponere &amp; tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> I will not diſpute with him about Terms and Expreſſions. Now to prove this, he asks, <hi>What is the Relation of a King to a Subject? His Dominion and Government. What is the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Subject to a King? His due Allegiance and Subjection: Then Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Government makes a King, and Allegiance a Subject; and Allegiance has as necceſſary a Relation to Dominion, as a Subject has to a King: If there be no King, there can be no Subject: If no Dominion and Government, there can be no Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Paternity is the Relation that makes a Father, and Filiation a Son: and Paternity and Filiation have as mutual and neceſſary reſpect to each other, as Father and Son. Theſe are call'd by Logicians Relative Acts: i. e.</hi> Logicians call Paternity and Filiation, <hi>Relative Acts:</hi> This is extraordinary, and the Dr. would have done well, to have told us, who thoſe Logicians are that call them ſo. <hi>Relations</hi> I know, they are call'd; but <hi>Relations</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Acts</hi> are two things. But for all that, the Dr. proceeds upon it, and asks, <hi>Why then may not I call Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Subjection Relative Duties?</hi> He may call them ſo if he pleaſe; but if he has no better Authority for it, than that Logicians call Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity and Filiation Relative Acts, he has none at all. But ſaith he, <hi>by which I explain'd what I mean't by Relatives.</hi> The Dr. call'd Government and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance Relatives;<note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg. p. 42.</note> and argued upon the ſuppoſition, that they were Relatives; and from thence draw'd a peremptory Concluſion, and ſaid, <hi>This is as certain as any Propoſition in Logick; and to extend Allegiance beyond the actual adminiſtration of Government, is to preſerve a</hi> Relative <hi>without its</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relate: <hi>for when one of the</hi> Relatives <hi>is loſt, the</hi> Relation <hi>is deſtroy'd.</hi> And I hope no body will be ſo obſtinate, as to ſay, that by <hi>Relatives,</hi> the Dr. meant <hi>Relatives;</hi> but that he meant <hi>Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> or <hi>Relative Acts,</hi> or <hi>Relative Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> or any thing rather than <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;</hi> for by <hi>Government and Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> being <hi>Relative Duties,</hi> the Dr. had explain'd what he meant by <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; i. e.</hi> he had ſaid Government and Allegiance were <hi>Relatives,</hi> and they are not <hi>Relatives,</hi> And can any body believe the Dr. ſhould mean things are, what they are not, tho he ſays ſo over and over: For this is all his Explication, He <hi>was</hi> ſpeaking of Government and Subjection, but he was ſpeaking of them as <hi>Relatives,</hi> and affirm'd them ſo to be, but ſeeing they are not ſo, therefore when he calls them ſo, he does not mean what he calls
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107829:39"/> them, but ſomething elſe: Now is it not a thouſand times better ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to own the miſtake of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, than to be put upon ſuch ſhifts to diſguiſe it; and then to colour the matter the better, to laugh away the notice of it; as the Dr. very grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>This I'm ſure, is only a Logical Banter, and ſo let it paſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well! but the Dr. hath explain'd himſelf now; and for once let us take a new account for an explication, and ſee whether he hath mended the matter; but here we are at ſome loſs, in the <hi>Caſe of Allegiance,</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Allegiance were <hi>Relatives,</hi> but in the <hi>Vindication</hi> (by way of Explication) <hi>they are the Relations that make the Relatives;</hi> and a few lines after, they are <hi>Relative Duties;</hi> and a little after,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 11.</note> they are <hi>Relations</hi> again. I remember the Dr. told me, <hi>I blunder'd for want of clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct notions of what I wrote.</hi> But mocking is catching: And here the Dr. <hi>blunders</hi> to ſome purpoſe, if ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confuſedly, backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be blundering, and all for want of <hi>having,</hi> or for want of <hi>laying down</hi> clear and diſtinct notions of what <hi>he</hi> writes. For as to Government and Subjection being <hi>Relative Duties,</hi> I doubt he muſt explain himſelf again. For <hi>Duties</hi> it ſeems they are, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know what <hi>Duties?</hi> Are they the <hi>Duties</hi> of <hi>Relations?</hi> If not, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Dr. in his next, to tell me what <hi>Duties</hi> they are: but if they are, then they are not the <hi>Relations</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but ſuch as flow from the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this is a plain contradiction to what he aſſerts before, that <hi>they are the Relations that make the Relatives.</hi> But truth will out: And this is the plain ſtate of the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe; for it is certain they are <hi>duties,</hi> and <hi>relative duties</hi> too, in the ſenſe thoſe words are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taken; that is, ſuch duties as ariſe from <hi>Relation,</hi> and are due to <hi>Relatives,</hi> And this plainly confutes the Drs. no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and arguments, for then they are not nor can be the Relations that make the Relatives; for the duty flowing from the Relation, and the Relation it ſelf are two very different things; not do they <hi>mutuo ſe ponere &amp; tollere;</hi> for the failure of the actual duties of the Relative does not deſtroy the Relation. And this is the Drs. fundamental mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, he confounds the Relation with the duty of that Relation, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he aſſerts,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the actual Adminiſtration of Government, as that ſignifies the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Poſſeſſion of Power and Authority to govern: And Allegiance as it means that Obedience and Subjection which is due to Government, are the Relations which make the Relatives,</hi> and do mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuo ſe ponere &amp; tollere. <hi>For what is the Relation of a King to a Subject? His Dominion and Government; what is the Relation of a Subject to a King? his due Allegiance and Subjection; then Dominion and Government makes a King, and Allegiance a Subject; and Allegiance has as neceſſary a Relation to Dominion, as a Subject has to a King,</hi> &amp;c. In anſwer to this I have theſe things to obſerve.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is an illogical, and prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous way of arguing, 'tis <hi>notum per ignotius,</hi> the Relatives are well enough known, but the Relations between the Relatives being abſtracted things, are not ſo eaſily, and in ſome caſes perhaps not at all underſtood. The Relatives Father and Son all men underſtand, and that there is a Relation between them; but there are not many, that have any formal Conception of Paternity and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; the Relatives Husband and Wife are evident enough, but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations between them are not ſo; and for ought I know have not a name in any Language; and if they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed very few would be the wiſer, who notwithſtanding would know well
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107829:39"/> enough, that there was a Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. And the Caſe is the ſame with reſpect to King and Subject, and the Relations between them; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives are plain and obvious, and well known, but the Relations are abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things, and not ſo diſtinctly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: And this is the reaſon, why ſeveral Relations have no names, and cannot be expreſſed without difficulty and artificial explication. And hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men have not been very inquiſitive about them, and there was no reaſon for it, as anſwering no end, or no good end, either a fruitleſs curioſity or worſe, to evade a Duty and perplex plain things. For the Relation is inſeparable from the Relative; and when you have found the Relative, you have found the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where a King is there is the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a King, and where is a Subject there is the Relation of a Subject; it would be a wiſe courſe, for a Son to ſeek his Father, by inquiring into the Relation of Paternity, or a Wife her Husband, by inquiring into the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Husband; at this rate we ſhould ſoon have a mad World on't, and we ſhould have as dutiful Children, and obedient Wives as we have Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: And this it ſeems pleaſes the Dr. beſt, he is for ſeeking the Sun in the dark, and the Subjects muſt find out their King by the Relations, which is the backſide of an Argument, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at the wrong end. In the <hi>Caſe of Allegiance</hi> the Dr. urg'd, that <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Allegiance were Relatives, and did</hi> mutuo ſe ponere &amp; tollere. And the Argument was proper and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical, if he could but have prov'd it; but when that would not do, then he is for a new ſtrein, and contrary to all methods of argumentation, is for prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the buſineſs by Relations, and would feign know, whether the <hi>Relative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues when the Relation is deſtroyed.</hi> And this is the difference between the Dr. before, and now, in his Caſe of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, <hi>the Relation ceaſed with the Relative,</hi> but in the Vindication <hi>the Relative ceaſes with the Relation,</hi> that is, becauſe a direct Argument cannot do it, a prepoſterous one muſt; and becauſe the notion of a <hi>Relative</hi> which all men underſtand, cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and intangled, the Dr. is for proving his point by <hi>Relations,</hi> which are not ſo well explained, nor put into terms, nor perhaps can be. The Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in all Caſes are plain enough, but the Relations between them are not ſo plain, nor are capable of being ſo; and the Dr. thought it more for his turn, when he was beaten out of the plain road to take by ways; and according to ſome new Rules of Logick, to prove a plain thing, by an obſcure one.</p>
            <p>And this is an anſwer to his Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>what is the Relation between King and Subject?</hi> And <hi>let our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor think of any thing elſe, wherein to place this relation if he can, beſides Actual Dominion, and Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on the one hand to make a King, and the obligations to Subjection and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance on the other hand to make a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi> And what if I could not think of any thing elſe? nor of that neither? do Relatives ceaſe to be Relatives, or muſt the Corrolate go round about the wood to look for his Relative, becauſe he cannot expreſly name the relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. There is a Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Husband and Wife, Maſter and Servant; and when he tells me what is the Relation between theſe Relatives, it will be time enough to anſwer him, and when he anſwers that he will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer himſelf; what is the Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Husband and Wife; why truly if the Dr. will expreſs it Logically, it is (in fine language) <hi>Husbandhood</hi> and <hi>Wifeſhip.</hi> And ſo by way of Logical Argument, if the Relation of <hi>Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> ceaſes the <hi>Wife</hi> is gone. And it a man has a mind to prove, that a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or Wife, are or are not ſo related,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107829:40"/> he muſt prove it forſooth from the <hi>Husbandhood</hi> and <hi>Wifeſhip,</hi> and then it is as plain as can be, and every body underſtands it; for the Dr. tells us ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Logically <hi>the Relative ceaſes with the Relation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That Actual Poſſeſſion of Power and Allegiance, are not the Relations which make the Relatives.</hi> This the Dr. aſſerts, and ought to have prov'd it, (for it is the foundation of this part of his diſcourſe:) But inſtead of that, he asks a Queſtion or two; <hi>what is the Relation of a King to a Subject? his Dominion and Government;</hi> (Actual Dominion he means,) <hi>what is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Subject to a King? His due Allegiance and Subjection;</hi> and ſo the matter is fully proved it is ſo, becauſe it is ſo; and this is very uſual with him, he takes for granted what hath moſt need to be proved; and then builds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own ſuppoſitions, and raiſes the force of his Arguments from them. Here he tells us, that <hi>Government and Allegiance are Relations,</hi> and to prove this he turns it into Queſtion and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and in that form ſays the ſame thing over again; and then away he runs with it, and draws his Arguments and Concluſions from it. And then <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion makes a King, and Allegiance a Subject, and if the Relation</hi> then <hi>of a King to his Subjects be Dominion and Government, does he continue a King,</hi> &amp;c. As if this was any more proved, when it was in the form of a Queſtion and Anſwer, then when it was in a Propoſition: Well! tho he has not prov'd that Government and Allegiance are the Relations, that make the Relatives; he hath ſaid enough in all Conſcience to prove they are not ſo; for he tells us, that <hi>By Allegiance,</hi> i. e. the Relation that makes the Relative of <hi>a Subject, he means that ſubjection and obedience that is</hi> due <hi>to Government;</hi> that is to ſay one Relation is <hi>due</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, filiation is <hi>due</hi> to Paternity which is extraordinary fine. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he asks, <hi>what is the Relation of a Subject to a King? His</hi> due <hi>Allegiance and Subjection,</hi> and afterwards in the next page, he calls it, the obligations <hi>to Subjection and Allegiance.</hi> And are not theſe pure Characters of a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? it would ſound rarely to ſay the <hi>Duty</hi> of filiation, or the <hi>obligations</hi> of filiation. And ſo to avoid one piece of <hi>Logical nonſenſe,</hi> we muſt make 2 or 3. And here we are at a loſs again, on one ſide of the leaf, the Relation of a Subject, is his <hi>due Allegiance;</hi> on the other, 'tis the <hi>Obligations to Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance;</hi> and <hi>due Allegiance</hi> it ſelf, and the <hi>Obligations to Allegiance</hi> are two things; and which would he have us take for the <hi>Relation,</hi> the <hi>Duty,</hi> or the <hi>Obligation?</hi> Allegiance it ſelf, or the obligations to it? And all this blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ariſes for want of laying down a <hi>clear and diſtinct notion</hi> of <hi>Relation,</hi> which is nothing elſe, but the reſpect the Relatives have to each other; and becauſe they have ſuch a Reſpect, thence ariſe the Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pective Acts, Duties, and Obligations; but theſe are not the Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect but flow from it, and are conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential to it. The Relation of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is Paternity, that is, a Father is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to his Son by being his Father, for being the Father of a Son is Paternity: But Paternal Authority, or the duty of Parents are not the Relation, but reſult from it: The Relation of a Son is filia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is a Son is related to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by being his Son. And this is the ſame in all other Relations; as the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Husband and Wife, Maſter and Servant, King and Subject; the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions conſiſt in the reſpect that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives have to each other; the Relation of a King to his Subjects is being their King: But Kingly Authority is no more the Relation of a King, than Paternal Authority is the Relation of a Father, but only reſults from his Relation, and is in nature conſequential to it. But I
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107829:40"/> expect the Dr. will ask me, what is the Relation of a King? But he knows well enough of the complaint of penury of words in this point; and that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays in ſuch caſes, we muſt invent words if it be needful to expreſs it. But it is all one to me, let him call it <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Sovereignty, Sovereign Power, Magiſtracy</hi> or <hi>Kingſhip;</hi> or what he pleaſes, provided he will but obſerve theſe two conditions. 1. That the meaning of them be not extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the notion of Relation, for they, and I think any other words whereby this may be expreſſed, are words of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous ſignification; and as in one ſenſe they may mean the Relation of a King, ſo in another ſenſe, they may mean the acts or duties that reſult from it: Government may mean actually go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, and then it may be the Act of the Relative, or the Act of one that is not the Relative; but neither in one ſenſe, nor the other is it the Relation of the Governour; and if it means that, it is in an abſtracted ſenſe, and is not to be taken for actual Government, actual Adminiſtration, or actual Power: For no act or duty of the Relative can be the Relation; but only for the bare and naked reſpect of the Governour to the Subject; for Logicians tell us, that <hi>Relationes ſunt nudae formae per quas Relata referuntur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That they only terminate on the Relative, for the <hi>Relative</hi> is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the <hi>Relation;</hi> and the Relation is the Relation of the Relative, but of no body elſe, tho he ſhould ſtand in the place of the Relative; if the Dr. likes to call the Relation of a King <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> be it ſo, but then it is only the Government of the true King, that is that Relation, but not of another, tho he actually adminiſters the Government of <hi>Sovereign Power,</hi> let it be ſo, but then it is the Power of the true Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, that is that Relation, not the Power of every one that gets into the place of the true Sovereign; Paternity is the Relation of a Father, but this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation can be extended to none but the true Father, what Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſoever another man may get in his Family; the Relation of a Husband (call it by what name you will) is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to his Perſon; and tho another man cohabits with his Wife, he does not therefore ſtand in the Relation of a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to her, nor ſhe in the Relation of a Wife to him.</p>
            <p>The truth is, all the Drs. <hi>Actual Adminiſtrations, actual Government, actual Poſſeſſion of Power</hi> are no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations at all, nor yet do they mean any thing, but as they proceed from the Relative. But if they proceed from any other beſides the Relative; they neither make, nor prove, nor are any ſigns at all of a Relation: Government is the Authority and Adminiſtration belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Relation of a King; and when it is adminiſtred by the King, 'tis valid and authoritative, and draws the Allegiance of the Subjects after it; but if it be adminiſtred by one that is not the King, that Adminiſtration does not make him a King, nor confer the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, nor make him ſtand in ſuch a Relation to the Subject. All Kingly Acts receive their force and validity, as they are Acts of the King, and not as Acts of Power; and the very ſame Acts done by another are nothing at all. Actual Allegiance or the ſame Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that is due to the Rightful King, may be performed with the ſame fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or with greater, and may be ſworn too, to one that is no King. But this does not make the Relation of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; at that rate a man may be a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject when he pleaſe, and to whom he pleaſe, and he may diſcharge himſelf as oft as he pleaſe. And I wonder what reaſon there is why actual Government ſhould make a King, any more than actual Allegiance makes a Subject; for the Dr. tells us, the Relations make the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107829:41"/> Relatives, Government makes a King, and Allegiance makes a Subject: And if actual Government makes a King, then actual Allegiance makes a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; for according to him Allegiance is as much the Relation of a Subject, as Government of a King. This the Dr. ſeems aware of, and therefore ſays, 'tis the Subjects <hi>due Allegiance:</hi> But if it be <hi>due Allegiance</hi> that makes a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; then I doubt it muſt be <hi>due Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> alſo that makes a King; and that is not meer Adminiſtration but Lawfull Authority.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That actual Adminiſtration of Government, or actual Poſſeſſion of Power, and Allegiance do not <hi>ſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuo ponere &amp; tollere.</hi> Here the Dr. tells us, <hi>They have a mutual and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary reſpect to each other; Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance has as neceſſary relation to Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as Subject to a King; if there be no King, there can be no Subject, if no Dominion and Government there can be no Allegiance:</hi> By this he means <hi>actual Dominion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 38.</note> as he ſays afterward, <hi>where actual Dominion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ceaſes, the Kingſhip is loſt and the obligations to ſubjection and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it would be ſufficient here to turn the Drs. Argument, and Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon himſelf, and to ask as he does, what are the <hi>Relations</hi> between actual Government and Allegiance: For it ſeems they are related as much as the Relatives themſelves. He tells us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that Government and Allegiance are the Relations between King and Subject. But I deſire to know what are the Relations between Government and Allegiance; for theſe it ſeems have a <hi>mutual and neceſſary reſpect to each other.</hi> Now 'tis egregious <hi>Logick</hi> to talk of the Relation of a Relation; and this is <hi>Progreſſus in Infinitum:</hi> For if there are Relations between the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then what are thoſe Relations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them? for thoſe Relations muſt have <hi>as mutual and neceſſary a reſpect to each other</hi> as the former Relations, and ſo on without end. And this is pure diſputing, and ſhews the vanity of ſuch new methods of argumentation; hitherto men have been ſatisfied, that the Relations are between the Relatives, and there was an end; but to talk of Relations between Relations is abſurd and ridiculous, and makes the Queſtion everlaſting.</p>
            <p>But as to the mutual being and ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of actual Government and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as to the reaſons againſt it, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath been ſaid before, and more will be ſaid preſently. I ſhall now on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew the abſurdity of it from exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but it is ſuch a one, as evidences the falſity of this aſſertion, and the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy of the Drs. Reaſonings to ſupport it better than any Arguments or trains of diſcourſe. It is the Caſe of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Martyr King <hi>Charles the Firſt.</hi> Now if this be true then when King <hi>Charles</hi> was kept Priſoner at <hi>Holdenby, Hampton Court, the Iſle of Wight</hi> and <hi>St. James</hi>'s; He ceaſed to be King, and the People of <hi>England</hi> owed him no Allegiance, nor were his Subjects. For I ſuppoſe, <hi>actual impriſonment</hi> is not <hi>actual Poſſeſſion of Power.</hi> And ſo it ſeems the High Court of Juſtice was in the right, and they did not murder their King, but only <hi>Charles Stewart:</hi> For tho the <hi>man was in being the King was gone,</hi> and went away with his actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Power. And the Dr. afterwards, <hi>for when God has taken away his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he has taken away his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to govern; for God never gives the Civil Authority, without the Civil Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The actual Poſſeſſion of Power, and the Duty of Allegiance are Relations at leaſt; and (ſaith the Dr.) <hi>if the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a King to his Subjects be Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Government, does he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a King, when he has loſt his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Government, or do his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107829:41"/> Subjects continue Subjects when he ceaſes to be King?</hi> And ſo by plain dint of Argument it ſeems King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Government was at an end ſome time before that horrid murder; and no duty of a Subject was owing to him, <hi>for one Relative cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt by it ſelf without its correlate.</hi> Now the ſhort of the matter is this, either King <hi>Charles</hi> was King notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his impriſonment; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his being diveſted of all <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Power, or he was not, if not then the attempting his life what crime ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver elſe it might be, was not Treaſon, nor within the Stat. of the 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. And the Indictment of the Regicides upon that Stat. was faulty, and they ought to be indicted, not as Traytors, but as Murderers. But if he was King all that time, then actual Poſſeſſion of Power, actual Adminiſtration, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Government, and the Allegiance of the Subject, have not ſuch a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and neceſſary reſpect to each other, as that the Allegiance of the Subject ceaſes upon the Princes not being in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of actual Power. Something of this I had ſaid before in the Caſe of <hi>Joaſh</hi> 
               <q>That Allegiance was due to him before he actually adminiſtred the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;<note place="margin">Poſtſcript p. 10.</note> nay, when an Uſurper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually adminiſtred it, and ſo it was to <hi>David</hi> when he fled out of the Country.</q> — But the Dr. it ſeems would trouble his readers no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that caſe. But here is another Caſe, tho the reaſon be the ſame, and if he pleaſe he may trouble himſelf to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it, and acquit himſelf from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, that that Caſe charges upon his Doctrine and Arguments.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, how is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he delivers here agreeable to the Anſwer he gives, with reſpect to the times of Uſurpation between 48. and 60. I had told him, that his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a Settlement would fit <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> and thoſe Uſurpers; and tho he had mention'd ſome differences, yet they made no difference in the Argument. This the Dr. denies, and ſays they were not ſetled according to his account of a Settlement not having a national con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and therefore they might, or they might not ſubmit; it was lawful, but not neceſſary nor matter of Conſcience, and they might be determin'd by their honour or intereſt; well ſuppoſe all this, and that thoſe Uſurpers were not <hi>ſo</hi> ſetled, were not each of them actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally poſſeſs'd of Power, Did they not <hi>actually</hi> adminiſter the Government? And this the Dr. (in that very anſwer) expreſly aſſerts, <hi>That the Power of the Nation was for ſome time in their hands:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 69.</note> And if it was in their hands then they <hi>actually poſſeſs'd it,</hi> and for the time they poſſeſs'd it, they muſt (according to him) be Sovereigns, at leaſt Sovereigns of Gods making, and the Allegiance of the Subject was ſo long due to them. <hi>For it is as certain as any propoſition in Logick, that actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al poſſeſſion of Power and Subjection are relations, and have a mutual and neceſſary reſpect to each other,</hi> and that <hi>Dominion and Government makes a King,</hi> But then what becomes of the fine pretences of Honour, Intereſt, and his notion of a thorough Settlement; for if theſe Uſurpers were not ſetled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his account of a Settlement, they were poſſeſſed of Power ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his account of Poſſeſſion of Power: And if <hi>Actual Government</hi> makes a King, <hi>Cromwel</hi> was a King, and had the Relation of a King; and the People were bound in Conſcience to ſubmit to him; and then I would feign know how the Drs. <hi>Honour and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> would excuſe them. Now tho the Dr. will not allow me, that his account of a thorough Settlement, fits <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> to all intents and purpoſes, his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Poſſeſſion of Power, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Government, <hi>fits him juſt as if it had been made for him.</hi> Now (to ſay no more) this is as great a Reflection upon thoſe Worthies of our
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107829:42"/> Church and Nation, as I had charg'd upon his account of a thorough Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Well! but this I ſuppoſe <hi>is a prejudice and no argument:</hi> But I will tell him what is an argument, and directly againſt him; and that is, that his Anſwer <hi>there</hi> is a plain contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all his Arguments and Aſſertions <hi>here;</hi> and I pray him to reconcile them. He hath given us a great many diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions already, but none of them will ſerve the turn; and if he pleaſe to find out one more to make his Anſwer there, and his Doctrine here to agree. For if actual Poſſeſſion of Power, and Allegiance have a mutual and neceſſary reſpect to each other, let him tell me, if he pleaſe, why the <hi>Rumps</hi> and <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels</hi> actual Poſſeſſion of Power, and the Subjects Allegiance had not as mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and neceſſary reſpect to each other, as the Actual Poſſeſſion of Power by any other Uſurper.</p>
            <p>The Dr. (by way of objection to what he had ſaid) ſays, <hi>All that I know that can be ſaid in this Cauſe (and which thoſe men muſt ſay, who make Allegiance inſeparable from Right) is only this, that the Relation continues as long as the</hi> fundamentum Relatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, <hi>that whereon the Relation is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed continues, and that being a Legal Right, while this Right remains, ſuch a Legal King, tho he be fallen from Power is King ſtill, and Subjects are Subjects ſtill, and owe Allegiance to him.</hi> By this time, I ſuppoſe, the Dr. may <hi>know that ſomething elſe may be ſaid in this Cauſe:</hi> And I know no manner of neceſſity why we muſt ſay ſo now; for the ſingle queſtion is whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Actual Government and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, are the Relations that make the Relatives, and do <hi>mutuo ſe ponere &amp; tollere:</hi> And this may be ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd without mingling the <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum Relationis</hi> in the diſpute. But this objection he made for his own ſake; and tho it be not needful for us to ſay, <hi>that the Relation continues, as long as the</hi> Fundamentum Relationis <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,</hi> it was very needful for him to ſay ſo. And it is the very anſwer he gives, to what I ſaid to prove,<note place="margin">P. 40.</note> that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Government and Allegiance do not <hi>mutuo ſe ponere &amp; tollere, if a Subject be taken captive, or otherwiſe hindred from paying actual Allegiance, is the Relation loſt, and does he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore immediatly ceaſe to be a Subject? And therefore neither doth a King, if he be hindred from the Actual Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Government, ceaſe to be a King; but hath the ſame Right to our Allegiance in, and out of Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> To this the Dr. replies, <hi>theſe two caſes are not parallel, in the firſt caſe, tho the Subject is taken captive; yet</hi> the Foundation of the Relation is not deſtroy'd, <hi>for his Prince is on his Throne ſtill in the Actual Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government, tho he be violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly torn from him, ſo that his Relation may continue, becauſe he has a Prince to whom he is related. But when the Prince is fallen from his Kingdom and Power,</hi> the Foundation of the Relation <hi>is at preſent deſtroy'd.</hi> And now we ſee the meaning of the Drs. objection, which was not to anſwer an objection of ours which we never made, nor need to make, but to prepare an Anſwer to an Argument, which otherwiſe he could not Anſwer. But for all this artifice he muſt have a good hand at reconciling contradictions, that can reconcile this Anſwer with his foregoing aſſertions. The Foundation of the Drs. Argument is, that <hi>Government and Allegiance are Relations, and do</hi> mutuo ſe ponere &amp; tollere; and then the ceaſing of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance deſtroys the Relation of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as much as the ceaſing of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment deſtroys the Relation of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance; and when a Subject falls from his Allegiance, he diſſolves the Relation of the Prince to him, as much as the Princes falling from actual Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107829:42"/> diſſolves the Relation of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. For this I take to be the meaning of <hi>muto ſe ponunt &amp; tollunt.</hi> But the Dr. whatſoever he had ſaid the leaf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is now for making a <hi>ſingle</hi> not <hi>mutual</hi> Reſpect of it: <hi>The Prince is in the Throne, and in the actual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration;</hi> and therefore the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is the Subject ſtill, whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of his Allegiance, and that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deſtroys the Relation between King and Subject, but the Princes loſing actual Government; but then what becomes of <hi>mutuo ſe ponunt &amp; tollunt,</hi> and <hi>Actual Government and Allegiance, having a mutual and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary reſpect to each other?</hi> that is not for me to know, and the Dr. may reconcile it, and if he pleaſe he may take his <hi>Fundamentum Relationis</hi> along with him to help him out. And yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all I muſt confeſs the Dr. has given a very good anſwer; for he ſays, that <hi>the King is on the Throne ſtill, tho the Subject is violently torn from him, and the Relation may continue, becauſe he has a Prince to whom he is related,</hi> and this is certainly true. But then it follows, the Relation of a Prince may <hi>continue,</hi> becauſe he has <hi>Subjects</hi> to whom he is related, for <hi>mutuo ſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunt,</hi> as well as <hi>tollunt:</hi> And if the Relation of a Subject continues, tho he be violently torn from his Prince, the Relation of a Prince continues, tho he be violently torn from his Subjects; for the reſpect is <hi>mutual,</hi> and the King hath no more Relation to the Subject, then the Subject to the Prince. But this ſame actual Adminiſtration ſerves many purpoſes: In the Caſe of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance it was a <hi>Relative,</hi> a little before it was the <hi>Relation</hi> that made the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and now it is <hi>Fundamentum Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationis.</hi> And what will it be next? In the <hi>Caſe of Allegiance,</hi> it was <hi>as certain as any propoſition in Logick</hi> that <hi>Actual Adminiſtration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Allegiance were Relatives, and did</hi> mutuo ſe ponere &amp; tollere three pages before it was <hi>as certain as any propoſition in Logick,</hi> that they were Relations and did the ſame thing; and <hi>now</hi> 'tis as certain as any propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Logick, that actual Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration does all the <hi>mutual</hi> buſineſs it ſelf. And it is as certain as any Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in Logick; that when men leave the plain and beaten paths, they get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a wood, and know not how to get out again.</p>
            <p>And now it is time to come to his Anſwer; and when he had made us ſay what he pleas'd, and tells us moreover we <hi>muſt</hi> ſay ſo, one would have thought that at leaſt he ſhould have anſwered that. But he will not vouchſafe any clear and plain anſwer to his own obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: For to a <hi>Legal Right being the</hi> Fundamentum Relationis; He thus anſwers, <hi>Now to ſhorten this diſpute,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 39.</note> 
               <hi>I ſhall only obſerve, that a Legal He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Right is not the</hi> Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Relationis. And what then! <hi>Legal Right</hi> may be the <hi>Foundation</hi> for all that. There are different kinds of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Right,</hi> and an <hi>Hereditary Right</hi> is one; the objection is general of a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Right,</hi> and the Anſwer is <hi>ſpecial</hi> of one of the <hi>Species.</hi> But let us hear his reaſon, <hi>for then there would be no Foundation, for this Relation between Prince and Subjects in any but Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Kingdoms,</hi> and why ſo? are there no <hi>Legal Rights</hi> to Government in any but Hereditary Kingdoms? and may not an <hi>Hereditary Right</hi> in Hereditary Kingdoms be the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the Relation, not as 'tis <hi>Hereditary,</hi> but as 'tis <hi>Legal,</hi> and other <hi>Legal Rights</hi> be the Foundation in other Kingdoms? But (ſaith he) <hi>the ſame R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>tion can have but one Foundation;</hi> very well, and then an <hi>Hereditary</hi> Right cannot be the Foundation, but a <hi>Legal</hi> Right may. For the <hi>Foundation</hi> may be one as 'tis <hi>Legal,</hi> tho divers as 'tis Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, or Elective: But (ſaith he) <hi>there
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107829:43"/> are a great many ways whereby Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are advanced to the Throne, an Hereditary Right, the Election of the People, the nomination of God, a Divine Entail and Conqueſt, which very much differ from each other;</hi> And what if they do differ in other reſpects: They may not differ as to their being <hi>Legal,</hi> for a Prince ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Throne any of theſe ways, or any other, may have a <hi>Legal</hi> Poſſeſſion of it; (And we are not now diſputing when <hi>Conqueſt</hi> becomes a <hi>Legal</hi> Title) But <hi>if all theſe be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent foundations there muſt be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds and ſpecies of Kingſhip.</hi> That may very well be though not becauſe the foundations are different in this reſpect: Different Laws and Conſtitutions may make different kinds of Government, though all theſe kinds are <hi>Legal</hi> according to the differing Laws of the reſpective Countries. And I wonder what the Doctor means when he immediatly adds, <hi>whereas the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between King and Subject is the ſame in all?</hi> Now he tells us, that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is the <hi>Relation</hi> of a King, and Allegiance the <hi>Relation</hi> of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and if the Relation be the ſame in all Countries, then Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Allegiance are the ſame in all Countries. And that is, that the Government and Allegiance in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is the ſame Government and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance with that in <hi>England,</hi> and both the ſame with that in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and all <hi>three</hi> the ſame all over the World. Now I always thought, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Allegiance were founded on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws and Conſtitution; as the Government and Allegiance in other Countries, were founded on their reſpective Laws. And then the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Relation between Prince and Subject, is the reſpective Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of each Country; which though they differ ſpecifically, as they are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Laws, yet they agree in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral as they are Laws. Now ſaith the Doctor, <hi>we muſt find out ſuch a foundation for this Relation, as will ſerve all Sovereign Princes;</hi> very well! and here we have found it, and that is the Laws of each Country. But this will not ſerve the Doctor; and therefore he ſays, <hi>and that can be no other but the Authority of God, by which Kings Reign, and to which Subjects owe Obedience:</hi> Very well, and grant him that too, the Queſtion ſtill returns, Is the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God the <hi>foundation</hi> of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation abſtracted from the Laws of each Country, or annexed to them? if abſtracted from the Laws, then Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Allegiance are the ſame in all Countries; for where the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Relation, and the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are the ſame, the Government conſtituted upon that foundation, and the duties flowing from that relation are the ſame likewiſe: But if they are not the ſame, as 'tis plain they are not, then whence ariſes the difference, not from the authority of God abſtracted from Laws (for that is the ſame in all Countries) but from the different Laws; and then the Authority of God is the foundation of this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that Authority is annexed to the reſpective Laws of each Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; there is a plain difference in this matter all over the World; and Subjects in one Country are bound in Conſcience to obſerve Duties of Relation differing to what Subjects are bound in another; and let the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor if he can give any other reaſon for it.</p>
            <p>The Doctor indeed tells us, that <hi>this is not always annexed to a Legal Right, but is always annexed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107829:43"/> to a full and ſetled poſſeſſion of the Throne. No man can have God's Authority who has not the actual Power and Authority of Government.</hi> But this is <hi>gratis dictum;</hi> and if the Doctor will give me leave, I ſhould rather believe, that God's Authority was with King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second in baniſhment, than with <hi>Cromwell</hi> who was poſſeſs'd of his Throne: <hi>for God's Authority is the Authority of Government;</hi> it is ſo, but it is the Authority of a <hi>Legal</hi> Government; illegal Government is no more God's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than Injuſtice and Unrighteouſneſs are God's Laws. But <hi>when Princes fall from Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> i. e. when they cannot actually go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, <hi>ſo far they loſe God's Authority;</hi> but that does not follow, for God's Authority is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd to the lawful Governors in and out of Poſſeſſion; as it was to <hi>Joaſh, David,</hi> and King <hi>Charles,</hi> tho each of them was hindred from actual Adminiſtration, by the reſpective Uſurpers that poſſeſs'd their Thrones.</p>
            <p>The Doctor adds, <hi>I grant in all other Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where the Relation it ſelf does not conſiſt in the Authority of Government, nor the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Relation ceaſe by falling from the actual Authority of Government, the caſe is different.</hi> What does he mean? That the Relatives, or (as the Doctor will have it) the Relations of King and Subject do only <hi>mutuo ſe ponere &amp; tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere,</hi> or that when the foundation of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ceaſes, that <hi>Relation ceaſes;</hi> but it is not ſo in all other Relations: he tells us, that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is the Relation of a King, and God's Authority is the foundation of that Relation; and that when theſe ceaſe, the Relation ceaſes and the Kingſhip is loſt. And then tells us, the <hi>Caſe is different,</hi> i. e. to my underſtanding this caſe differs in other Relations: now tho there is a difference between the Relation of King and Subject, and other Relations, yet as to their mutual being, and ceaſing, there is no difference; and that I think is the Caſe,<note place="margin">Poſtſcript p. 9.</note> and was the Caſe I put, and which the Doctor here refers to. <hi>To ſay that actual Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Government and Alleg. are Relatives, is to ſay that the actual Government of a Maſter and the Obedience of Servants are Relatives; ſo that if a Maſter be ſpirited away, or taken captive, ſo as he can give no directions in his Family nor actually govern it, his Servants ceaſe to be his Servants, and the Relation is extinct,</hi> &amp;c. And here let us try the Doctor's Argument; <hi>Now tho the Government of the Maſter, and the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Servant, are not Relatives, yet they are the Relations that make the Relatives, and de</hi> mutuo ſe ponere &amp; tollere; <hi>for what is the Relation of a Maſter to a Servant? his Dominion and Government: and what is the Relation of a Servant to his Master? his due Obedience and Subjection: then Dominion and Government ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e.</hi> And let me ask the Doctor's Queſtion, <hi>What is the Relation between Maſter and Servant? let him think of any thing elſe if he can, wherein to place it, beſides the actual Government of a Maſter on the one hand to make a Maſter, and the obligation to ſubject him on the other hand to make a Servant; then where the actual Government of a Maſter ceaſes, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhip is loſt, and the Subjection of his Servants with it. The Man is in being, but the Maſter is gone.</hi> Now upon this way of arguing I doubt the abſurdity will follow which I urg'd upon him before, that if a Maſter, after his Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, return to his Liberty, and to his Family, his Houſe and Family are beſtowed upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Maſter that will govern it, for they have nothing more to do with him; the Relation was only between his actual Government and their Obedience, and according to the Doctor in his new book, <hi>When the Relation is deſtroy'd the Relative ceaſes.</hi> Now to evade this I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Doctor ſays, <hi>The caſe is different in all other Relations;</hi> for he immediately inſtances <hi>as between Parents and Children, Maſters and Servants, where the Relation is founded in nature, or purchaſe, or civil Contracts under the ſuperior Direction and Government of the Civil Authority, tho the Maſter of a Family, as he ſays, be ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, or taken Captive, his Servants, Houſe and Family, do not preſently fall to the lot of the next Poſſeſſor, but muſt be diſpoſed of by the Laws of the Country, and the Authority of the Prince; for ſuch private and peculiar Intereſts are ſubject to publick Laws and a ſuperior Authority.</hi> This is true enough, but no Anſwer; for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Queſtion is whether actual Government and Obedience be Relatives, or in the Doctors new language Relations, and do <hi>mutuo ſe pone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107829:44"/> &amp; tollere:</hi> if the Doctor would have given a direct Anſwer to this, it would have ſhew'd the weakneſs and inconſequence of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Relatives and Relations. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that he turns off to another buſineſs, and gives a Reaſon why a man's Houſe and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily does not fall to the next Poſſeſſor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Laws of the Country have provided for it; and ſo they have; and have not the Laws of the Country provided for Alleg. alſo? and I would fain ſee a Reaſon why the Alleg. of the Subject is not under the direction of the Law, as well as his Houſe or Eſtate? or why the Government muſt fall to the lot of the next Poſſeſſor, any more than the Subjects Houſe or Family? For all Property is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Right, as well the Kings Property as the Prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rty of the Subject, and the Law hath taken as much, and a great deal more care of the Property of the King, than of that of any of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Subjects. And I wonder why the Law ſhould not do the King Right as well as the Subject. And this is no more than the Conſequence of what the Doctor himſelf aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, for he tells us the diſpoſſeſſed Prince hath ſtill the <hi>Legal Right:</hi> and if he hath the <hi>Legal Right,</hi> then the Law would reſtore him to the poſſeſſion of it, if the Law might take its courſe, and was duly obſerved. But (ſaith the Doctor) <hi>The Authority of God is at his own diſpoſal;</hi> right, and ſo is every thing elſe at God's diſpoſal as well as Authority; and the Doctrine of Providence ſufficiently proves it. But that does not make every man's Houſe or Family fall to the lot of the next Poſſeſſor, but they muſt notwithſtanding be diſpos'd of by the Laws of the Country. But then why does it make the Crown fall to the lot of the next Poſſeſſor? Are there no dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Laws for that as well as for the other? The Doctor's Reaſon, <hi>When the Kings Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> i. e. his actual poſſeſſion of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>is loſt, there is no higher Tribunal to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to, but to God, who removeth and ſetteth up Kings,</hi> is fallacious; for the Law is to be <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd</hi> to, which determines the Rights of Kings, and ſecures them too, as well as the Rights of the Subject. <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York appeal'd</hi> to the Laws, to make good his Right againſt <hi>Henry</hi> 6. and the Laws carried it againſt the Poſſeſſor. But it ſeems the Law ſecures the Subjects Right out of Poſſeſſion, and will do him juſtice, and help him to recover it; but for a King out of Poſſeſſion, the Law makes him a Right indeed; but he muſt get into the Poſſeſſion of it when he can, the Laws can lend him no aſſiſtance; and tho it does Right to every man elſe, it will do him none.</p>

Nor does it affect the Caſe in diſpute; for who doubts but Subjects may ſubmit to the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, if they have no legal King, or know of none; but the Queſtion is, Whether they may lawfully do the ſame, when they have a rightful King, and know it: and whether a humane Entail does not make a rightful King in other Kingdoms as well as a divine Entail did in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah?</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently whether Subjects in other Kingdoms can lawfully ſubmit and own the Authority of an Uſurper when the right Heir is living and known, any more than they could do ſo in the ſame circumſtances in the Kingdom of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah.</hi> And that they cannot, I think I have ſufficiently prov'd; and let us ſee what the Doctor ſays to diſprove it.</p>
            <p>My reaſon was, <q>For God's entailing the Crown of <hi>Judah</hi> was the Law of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in that reſpect, and the People of other Kingdoms are as much bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their own Laws, as the People of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> were theirs. All humane Laws that are juſt bind in Conſcience, and (according to the Doctor's own Principles) thoſe Laws were made by God's Authority. So that the Doctor miſtakes the Queſtion; we do not oppoſe humane Laws to God's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but we oppoſe Laws which are made by God's Authority, and which are Rules to us, to Providence, which is no Rule. When God entail'd the Crown upon <hi>David</hi>'s Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they had then a legal Right to it, and ſo hath every family in other Kingdoms, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which an Entail is made by the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Laws of the Country.</q> Thus far the Doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>King</hi> Charles <hi>the Second had as good a Right to the Crown of</hi> England <hi>as</hi> Joaſh <hi>had to that of</hi> Judah, <hi>and</hi> Cromwell<hi>'s Uſurpation was no more a bar to him, nor gave him by his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This I thought was a pertinent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to illuſtrate and confirm the truth of what I have ſaid, and perhaps the Doctor thought ſo too, and therefore let it alone. This to <hi>my Underſtanding</hi> (which the Doctor is ſatisfied is not very good) would have brought the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie home;<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 71.</note> and if the Doctor would have anſwered directly, he muſt either have aſſerted that King <hi>Charles</hi> had not as <hi>good</hi> a Right to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> as <hi>Joaſh</hi> had to that of <hi>Judah,</hi> or elſe he muſt have forſaken his Diſtinction, and I now give him notice of it, and deſire him in his next to give me a plain and categorical Anſwer to it.</p>
            <p>In the mean time let us conſider what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer he hath made to ſo much as he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of; but here he is at the old trade again, of asking twenty Queſtions inſtead of anſwering one. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what would our Author prove from this? That in every heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Kingdom the legal heir has a legal Right to the Crown as well as in</hi> Judah; <hi>and did I ever deny it?</hi> No Sir, you did not deny it in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect terms, but you have done as good as deny it; for you allow he hath a legal Right ſtill; but then it ſeems it is ſuch a Right, as
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107829:45"/> thoſe Perſons who next to himſelf are moſt concern'd in it, are bound to keep him from it: for what legal Right hath a King of any Kingdom, but by the Laws of that Kingdom, and whom do the Laws of that Kingdom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect but the People of that Kingdom; and if the People who are under the immediate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of thoſe Laws are bound to do him no Right, nay are bound to oppoſe it, then he can have no Right done him by vertue of the Laws that give him his Right, and that I think is equivalent to no Right at all. The Doctor in his <hi>Caſe of Alleg.</hi> gives a pleaſant account of this matter;<note place="margin">P. 26.</note> He tells us, That God's Providence (in ſetting up an Uſurper) <hi>does not diveſt the diſpoſſeſſed Prince of his legal Right nor forbid him to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Throne, nor forbid thoſe who are under no obligations to the Prince in poſſeſſion, to aſſiſt the diſpoſſeſſed Prince to recover his legal Right.</hi> That is to ſay, a Foreigner who is not concern'd in the Laws of the Country, may do the Prince Juſtice according to the tenor of theſe Laws, when the Kingdom whoſe Laws they are, are in Juſtice and Conſcience bound to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. The Prince hath his legal Right by the Laws of the Land, and the People are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the direction and obligation of the Laws of the Land. And if the Laws have any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, in all reaſon it muſt be on the People whoſe Laws they are; and it is unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble how a Stranger may juſtly give the Prince his Right according to the Laws of the Land; and yet the People whoſe Laws they are, cannot in juſtice do it, nay are bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to hinder it as much as they are able; it is as much as to ſay, that a Judge and Jury whoſe proper buſineſs it is ought not to do Right to the oppreſſed, but the Mob, or any body elſe, may juſtly do it. I know an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Prince may crave aid of a Foreigner, and he may juſtly aſſiſt him, but it is in thoſe caſes only, where his Subjects are bound to do him Right, but will not. But I would fain know how it is righteous in a Foreigner to do Right according to the Law of the Land, and yet unrighteous in the People to do it, nay very righteous to oppoſe it. But the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor hath given us ſuch a Legal Right that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was heard of, A Right in Fiction and <hi>in nubibus,</hi> which neither hath nor can be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by vertue of the Laws, nor the Proviſions it makes. The Law makes a Right, and every perſon within the compaſs and extent of thoſe Laws is bound to oppoſe it; but any body elſe, who is out of the bounds and power of the Law, may honeſtly effect it: in ſhort, it is ſuch a legal Right, which is under the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of foreign force, but out of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, power, or obligation of the Laws that make it: it is ſuch a legal Right which juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies any perſon, who is not concern'd with the Laws, to eſtabliſh it. But thoſe who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the direction of the Laws by which the Right is, are bound to prevent it. And that is, it is a legal Riddle, which no body can expound.</p>
            <p>The Doctor goes on with his Queſtions, <hi>Or</hi> (would he prove) <hi>that the ſtanding Laws of every Country are the Rule for Subjects in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up Kings, when it is their own Act and Choice, and who denies this too?</hi> Now I am not very well ſatisfied with the wording of this; <hi>Free Act and free choice</hi> in ſetting up Kings, is not very ſuitable to hereditary Kingdoms; and in the ſame manner he expreſſes it a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>No man ever deny'd but that in making Kings, Subjects are bound by the Laws of the Land when it is their own free and voluntary Act.</hi> But ſuppoſing he means innocently however he hath expreſs'd it: This I ſay, if it be the Duty of Subjects, and they are bound to own their legal King, then how comes the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be their duty, and they are bound to diſown and reject him. Force I grant may ſuſpend a Duty, and hinder the performance, but can never make it none, or alter the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of moral duties. This is a pure account of a moral duty; it is the Subjects <hi>duty</hi> to own the King by legal Right when they are free, but when they are under force it is their <hi>duty</hi> to kill and deſtroy him. If it be a duty when they are free, how comes the contrary to be a duty when they are under force. The being free, and being under force, makes ſome difference as to t e actual performance, but none as to the habit and obligation; while the force continues the Act is ſuſpended, but the habit remains and the obligation conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues; and if it be a duty when they are free, 'tis a duty alſo when they are under force. And the <hi>free choice,</hi> and <hi>voluntary Acts</hi> the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ſpeaks of is no d fference in the du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107829:45"/> was due to <hi>Joaſh,</hi> and to <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, all the time of their diſpoſſeſſion, tho their Loyal Subjects, who were under the force of the Reſpective Uſurpers could not perform it. The Dr. ſays, <hi>his Hypotheſis is not concern'd in this Queſtion.</hi> But I think it is, and that conſiderably: for if the Queſtion be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Subjects are bound to own and adhere to the King by Legal Right, when they are free, I would fain know how they become bound to the clean contrary, to diſown him, and reject him, when under force, how it is their <hi>duty</hi> in Conſcience to ſet him up when free; and their <hi>duty</hi> in Conſcience alſo, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him, and kill him, when under force. But of this before.</p>
            <p>As to what the Dr. ſays, <hi>that no man ever deny'd, but that in making Kings, Subjects are bound by the Laws of the Land, when it is their own free and voluntary Act:</hi> I ſhall leave him to diſpute the Point with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention: And becauſe we are upon Queſtions, he may anſwer theſe Two when he pleaſe: 1. Whether the ſetting up King <hi>William,</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> were not their own free and voluntary Act? And, 2. Whether it were agreeable to the Laws of the Land, or in the Drs. own words, Whether they made the Law their Rule? If he anſwers the Firſt affirmatively, and the Second negatively, 'tis plain <hi>Satyr</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective</hi> againſt them; and the Convention, I ſuppoſe, will not take it well from him, as he ſays, the complying <hi>Nobility and Gentry will not take it well</hi> from me (<hi>p.</hi> 65.) if he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers both affirmatively. His Hypotheſis of <hi>Illegal and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Powers</hi> is a meer trifle, and ſhews only how the Dr. can diſpute about no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Dr. hath not done with his Queſtions; but hath three or four more, which I am not concern'd to repeat; nor can I gueſs for what end he made ſo many Queſtions, or any at all: He asks indeed, what I would prove; and then fills a whole Page with Queſtions. But he underſtands it well enough: for immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after his Queſtions, he adds, <hi>The ſumm of his Argument is this, that a Humane En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of the Crown, made by the Laws of any Country, does in all Caſes, and to all intents and purpoſes, as much oblige Subjects, as a Divine Entail, which is only the Law of the Kingdom too: for the People of other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms are as much bound to obſerve their own Laws, as the People of</hi> Judah <hi>were theirs.</hi> Now if this be that which I would prove, what need was there of ſo many previous Queſtions, to entangle a plain thing; and I own this is that which I would prove; only I except againſt <hi>his all Caſes, and to all intents and purpoſes,</hi> which are his words and not mine; and I will no more anſwer for his ſenſe, than he will for mine: My words are <hi>as much bound,</hi> which the Dr. ſums up too; and adds, <hi>in all Caſes,</hi> and <hi>to all intents,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as much oblige:</hi> whereas it is enough if they oblige <hi>as much</hi> in the preſent Caſe, and to the Preſent purpoſe, without running any further. And I do aſſert, that Entails of the Crown made by Humane Laws, do <hi>as much</hi> oblige the Subjects to own the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Rightful King by thoſe Laws, and to diſown the Authority of an Uſurper, as the Entail of God upon the Poſterity of <hi>David,</hi> did oblige the Subjects of <hi>Judah,</hi> to own <hi>Joaſh,</hi> and to Depoſe and Slay <hi>Athaliah:</hi> and let us ſee what the Dr hath to ſay to it.</p>
            <p>He replys, <hi>The Diſpute in general, about the Authority and Obligation of Humane Laws, is very impertinent to this purpoſe; for no man denyes it.</hi> Very well: but I doubt they muſt oblige as much, and in ſuch Caſes only, as will fit the Drs. turn. <hi>But yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we think Divine Political Laws, much more ſacred, and univerſally obligatory, than any meer Humane Laws, tho made by men, who have their Authority of Government, and conſequently of making Laws from God: and I believe the Author is the firſt man who has equalled Humane Laws, with thoſe Laws which are immediately given by God.</hi> Now I thought the Dr. had ſome fetch in putting in theſe ſame <hi>in all Caſes, and to all intents and purpoſes.</hi> But did I ever ſay, that <hi>meer Humane Laws,</hi> were as <hi>ſacred</hi> as Divine Laws? but as to their obligation, the Subjects in other Countrys are <hi>as much</hi> oblig'd to obſerve their Political Laws, as the People of <hi>Judah</hi> were theirs; tho the one is made by God himſelf, and the other by his Authority. And this for the Reaſon that I gave; becauſe <hi>all Humane Laws that are juſt bind in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> And need the Dr. be told, what is the meaning of Humane Laws binding <hi>in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which hath an immediate Reſpect to the Law of God. And the formal Reaſon that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107829:46"/> Humane Laws oblige <hi>in Conſcience,</hi> is not, becauſe they are <hi>meer</hi> Humane Laws (as the Dr. hath a mind to phraſe it) but becauſe it is the declared Will of God, they ſhould be obey'd; and the obligation <hi>in Conſcience</hi> to Humane Laws, is reſolv'd only into the Law of God. And I hope the obligation may be equal with reſpect to the Law of God, tho the Laws themſelves are not equal <hi>in all Caſes, and to all intents and purpoſe.</hi> And I wonder where is the ſingularity of aſſerting this, as the Dr. out of extraordinary candor hath a mind to inſinuate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Diſpute between Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane Laws, and a Divine and Humane Entail of the Crown, are of a very different nature, tho they be both the Laws of the Country for which they are made: i. e.</hi> tho they are both Laws, and tho they both receive their binding power as they are Laws: and tho the difference the Dr. contends for, is, that the one is a Law of God; and the other is a Law of man: Yet it ſeems the Diſpute about Laws would not ſerve the Turn; and therefore they muſt be conſidered not as Laws, but as <hi>Entails;</hi> tho I muſt confeſs, I can ſee no difference in that: for if they are Entails, they are Laws; and they are Laws, as they are Entails. And I do not very well ſee how their Conſideration can be ſever'd, or what need there is for it. But for all that,<note place="margin">P. 43.</note> the Dr. tells us, <hi>it will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily appear, if we compare God's making Kings by a Providential Settlement of them in the Throne, with a Divine, and with a Humane Entail. A Divine Entail is God's ſetling the Crown on ſuch a Family by the expreſs Revelation of his Will; and tho God ſhould after this, ſettle a Prince in the Throne by his Providence, to whom the Crown did not belong by this Entail, ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence will not juſtifie Subjects, in ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſuch a Providential King, when it is in their Power to ſet the Right Heir upon the Throne: for this would be to expound Providence againſt the expreſs Revelation of God's Will: But a Humane Entail, is only a Providential Settlement of the Crown on ſuch a Family; and what is ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>led by Providence again: for where God makes Kings only by Providence, he can unmake them by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence alſo, and make new ones.</hi> And what is all this to the Purpoſe? and what ſignifies this tedious Relation of his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> which we muſt have at every turn? And what is this, to the difference of the diſpute between Divine and Humane <hi>Laws,</hi> and Divine and Humane <hi>Entails?</hi> All that concerns that, is that <hi>a Divine Entail is God's Providential Setling the Crown, by the expreſs Revelation of his Will: i. e.</hi> it is a Divine Law. And a <hi>Humane Entail, is only God's Providential Settlement of the Crown on ſuch a Family;</hi> and that is, he hath ſetled it by a <hi>Humane Law.</hi> And I would fain know, whether it binds as an Act of Providence, or as a Law. But it ſeems the Laws of Entail, are to be ſubmitted to, not as <hi>Laws,</hi> but as <hi>Providences.</hi> And if we muſt talk in this Cant, I ſay, that a Divine Entail, is God's Providential Settlement of the Crown, by expreſs Revelation; that a Humane Entail is God's Providential Settlement by a Humane Law, but <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation</hi> is a bare Act or Permiſſion of Providence, and no Settlement of the Crown at all. And why does a bare Act or Permiſſion of Providence, defeat a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Settlement by Humane Law, any more than it does a Providential Settlement by Divine Law? The Dr. ſays, <hi>what is ſetled by Providence, may be unſetled by Providence again.</hi> Very well, but then it is the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Providence. The Dr. ſays, we muſt <hi>not expound Providence againſt the expreſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of God's Will.</hi> And I reply, we muſt not expound a bare Act or permiſſion of Providence, againſt a Providential Settlement by Law.</p>
            <p>But all this while my Anſwer is not touch'd, which is <hi>that the people of other Kingdoms are as much bound to obſerve their own Laws, as the people of</hi> Judah <hi>were theirs.</hi> God's Entail was the Political Law of that Kingdom, and a Humane Entail is the Law of other Hereditary Kingdoms: and the Laws of other Countrys oblige in Conſcience, as well as the Laws of <hi>Judah.</hi> And if it was not lawful to own the Authority of an Uſurper in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> becauſe contrary to their Laws, and their obligations to them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ſo in any other Country for the ſame reaſon But here the Dr. ſhifts, and tells us <hi>that the Diſpute about the Authority and Obligation of Humane Laws is impertinent to the purpoſe,</hi> but gives no reaſon, except
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107829:46"/> his ſaying, <hi>for no man deny; it,</hi> be a reaſon; he ſays after, <hi>that the Diſpute between Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane Laws, and Divine and Humane Entails, are of a very different nature.</hi> And it may be ſo, or it may not be ſo, for any thing he hath ſaid (for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring a Divine and Humane Entail makes no difference in that particular) but this is trifling and amuſing, not anſwering. The ſingle Queſtion is, whether they are Laws or no Laws, and are to be conſider'd as ſuch; is a Humane Entail, the Law of an Hereditary Kingdom; and does it oblige as ſuch? Then if other Kingdoms are as much bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Laws, as the people of <hi>Judah</hi> were theirs, it plainly follows, that Uſurpation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be admitted againſt a Legal Right in other Kingdoms, any more than it could in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah.</hi> But this is <hi>impertinent to the purpoſe, i. e.</hi> to the Drs. purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Dr. goes on, <hi>This diſcovers the fallacy of what he adds, We do not oppoſe Humane Laws to God's Authority, but we oppoſe Laws that are made by God's Authority, and which are a Rule to us, to Providence, which is no Rule.</hi> Well! This I ſaid, and where is the fallacy? <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I would ask the Author, whether the Laws of</hi> England, <hi>which entail the Crown, are not Humane Laws?</hi> To which I anſwer, yes: and moreover, they bind in Conſcience, with reſpect to the Laws of God. But I cannot tell what the Dr. will call them, whether <hi>Providential Settlements,</hi> or <hi>Providences:</hi> for it ſeems they have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the Peoples Subjection, otherwiſe than as they are <hi>Providences,</hi> and not as Laws backt with God's Authority. But (ſaith he) <hi>if they be, I ask whether they do not oppoſe theſe Humane Laws to the Authority of God, in making Kings by his Providence?</hi> I anſwer no: for God makes Kings by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence according to Legal Right. But it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Queſtion, Whether an Uſurper poſſeſſed of the Throne by Providence, be a King of God's making, or be made a King by God's Authority. And the Queſtion, as the Drs. puts it, is Sophiſtical: he mixes and confounds what ought to be divided, Whether Kings are made by God's Authority, and whether they are made by Providence, are two Queſtions, which he makes one; when Kings are made according to Legal Right, they are made by God's Authority; for the Laws have God's Authority: But that a Providential Poſſeſſion of the Throne is God's Authority, or that a Perſon ſo poſſeſſed, is made a King by God's Authority, is that which the Dr. hath not yet, and I ſuppoſe, will not be able to prove.</p>
            <p>The Dr. adds, <hi>to avoid this, he will not call them Humane Laws, but Laws made by God's Authority.</hi> To avoid what? That Sophiſtical Queſtion before? I never ſo much as thought of it. And I do not ſee how I ſhould; for it affects nothing that I have ſaid. And now I do know it, I do not ſee any ſuch ſtrength in it, as will need any Art or Pains to avoid it. But to ſave him further trouble, I will tell him all the deſign I had in ſaying the Laws were made by God's Authority, was only to ſhew the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of Humane Laws, that they bound in Conſcience, and were a Rule to us, and which Providence was not: and therefore all the pains the Dr. takes to prove, that Humane Laws are not Divine Laws, concerns not me at all, nor the Queſtion: He diſputes only againſt his own fancy; and therefore I ſhall not trouble the Reader with that, but go on to the next.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Well!</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but theſe Laws are our Rule. They are ſo, when they are not over-ruled by a Superiour Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 44.</note> 
               <hi>but that they may be by the Authority of God.</hi> Very true. But are the Acts or Permiſſions of Providence, that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God that over-rules the Laws? Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Laws are under God's Authority, as well as Humane Laws, and may be over-ruled by him when he pleaſe. But that is no proof, that Acts of Providence over-rule them. And the Queſtion is not whether God's Authority may over-rule Humane Laws, but whether by meer Providence he doth over-rule them: and till God doth over-rule them, they are our Rule. <hi>And the Providence of God is not our Rule.</hi> Well, this I ſaid: To this he replyes, <hi>if by this he means, we muſt not make Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the Rule of Good and Evil to us,</hi> i. e. <hi>that we muſt not think it lawful for us to do what ever the Providence of God does, I grant it: For the Laws of God are the Rules of Good and Evil, not his Providence:</hi> Very well; <hi>We muſt not think it lawful to do whatſoever the Providence of God does:</hi> but
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107829:47"/> may we think it lawful to do <hi>any thing</hi> that the Providence of God does, as it is meerly an Act of Providence, in oppoſition to a plain and known Rule, allow'd and authoriz'd by God himſelf, as is the Caſe of Humane Laws? This is the ſingle point: But let us ſee what a kind of Rule the Dr. makes of Providence. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if he means the Providence of God cannot direct our duty, cannot lay ſome new obligations on us, and diſcharge the old ones, this is manifeſtly falſe in a thouſand inſtances.</hi> What does Providence do this as a <hi>Rule?</hi> That is the Queſtion: And I doubt to make it out, that we muſt have a new no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Rule,</hi> as we have had of Providence, and a through Settlement: What if Providence direct our duty? it does not make it; but the duty is to be meaſured by the Rule, and not by Providence. What if Providence layes new obligations on us, and diſcharges the old ones? the obligation and the diſcharge too, are to be taken from the Rule, and not from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; and we are not to practiſe by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but by the Rule. And if Providence be contrary to the Rule, <hi>it directs no duty, nor lays any new obligations, nor diſcharges the old ones,</hi> Except it be quite contrary to the Drs. meaning; if a man by Providence uſurps another mans poſſeſſion, all the Duty Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence directs to, and all the obligation it lays, is to have juſtice done, and the poſſeſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to the right owner. So that I doubt the Drs. <hi>thouſand inſtances</hi> will come very ſhort; and what are thoſe Inſtances? <hi>Every new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition Providence puts us in, every new Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it creates, it requires ſome duties, and lays ſome new obligations on us.</hi> And what then? Is Providence the Rule of thoſe duties, or thoſe obligations? This is manifeſtly falſe; or is Providence the Rule of that Condition, or of that new Relation? This is manifeſtly falſe alſo: Suppoſe Providence puts a man into a ſtate of ſufferings, or into a ſtate of plenty, or any other ſtate; the juſtice or injuſtice of theſe ſufferings, or proſperity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not to be meaſur'd from Providence, but from ſome other Rule. Man and Wife come together by Providence, but whether they are related, and a relation is thereby contracted, is not to be known by Providence, but by the Rule that directs and appoints that Relation. But if a Man and Woman come together, but not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to God's Ordinance, they are not Man and Wife, nor is there any ſuch relation between them; tho one is by Providence, as well as the other: from whence nothing is more plain, than that Providence is no Rule in ſuch caſes, nor is any Relation to be known meerly from Providence, but from ſome other Rule. And this ſhews the fallacy of what follows: <hi>I ſhall inſtance</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>only in the Caſe before us, if the Providence of God can remove one King, and ſet up another, this does not alter the duty of Subjects to their Prince, yet it changes the object of their Allegiance, as it changes their Prince, the Laws of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the duty of Subjects to their Prince, but the Providence of God makes him.</hi> Now grant all this, the difficulty ſtill remains: Is Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the Rule whereby to diſcover, whether or no the object of Allegiance is chang'd, or whether one King is remov'd from being King, and another ſet up? When a Maſter is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd from his Family, or a Husband from his Wife, there are by Providence; but if it be not according to the Laws of God in one Caſe, and according to the Laws of the Society in the other, the Acts of Providence are no Evidence, that the objects of the reſpective duties are chang'd, nor are a Rule for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants or Wife, to pay the reſpective duties to thoſe who poſſeſs the place or ſtation of the Perſons ſo remov'd by Providence. But the truth is, all this is Ambiguous and Sophiſtical. God makes, and removes, and ſets up Kings by his Providence, and ſo he does Husbands and Maſters. But every Perſon that poſſeſſes the places of theſe by Providence, is not therefore a King, a Husband, a Maſter, but ſuch only who poſſes them according to the reſpective Laws and Rules that conſtitute and appoint them. And therefore altho it be true, that God makes Kings, Husbands, and Maſters, by his Providence; yet it is true likewiſe, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may by Providence ſuſtain the places of them, and yet be neither of theſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Providence is no Rule, nor can determine our Practices and Duties; but in all ſuch caſes we are to be judg'd by Laws, and not by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences. A Woman is not determin'd by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, whether a Man that co-habits with her, be her Husband; nor is a Subject determin'd by Providence, whether the Perſon that Poſſeſſes the Throne be his King, but by the Laws,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107829:47"/> which direct to the Perſon (as all other Laws do) as well as to the Duty: and which are a Rule to us, warranted by God himſelf, and back'd with his Authority; and Providence is no Rule, nor have we any wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ant or direction to obſerve it as ſuch. And therefore, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Dr. hath here ſaid, the charge ſtands good againſt him. <hi>That the Dr. miſtakes the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Poſtſcript, p.</note> 
               <hi>we do not oppoſe Humane Laws to God's Authority, but we oppoſe Laws which are made by God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and which are Rules to us, to Providence, which is no Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let us conſider the oppoſition he makes, between Humane Laws of Entail, and Providence; for he confeſſes, they do oppoſe Laws made by Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that is the Laws of the Land which entail the Crown, to Providence, or to the Providence of God in making Kings.</hi> I do confeſs it, and I thought I had told him wherein the oppoſition conſiſted, that the one was a Rule, and the other none: but (ſaith he) <hi>that is they think themſelves bound in Conſcience, to adhere to that king, tho out of poſſeſſion, who by the Laws of the Land has a Legal Right to the Crown, againſt that King, who is actually ſetled in the Throne by the Providence of God. Now if we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſenſe of things, and not the words; this is no more than to ſay, that they oppoſe the Providence of God againſt Providence, his former Providence againſt his later Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; that is, they will not allow the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, to change and alter, whatever Reaſons the Divine Wiſdom ſees for it: but what God has once done, that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to abide by, whatever he thinks fit to do afterwards, which is to oppoſe God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and to</hi> Shackle. (Does not tell me,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 24.</note> 
               <hi>That I write at that Rate, that ſome people may ſuſpect that I had a mind to ridicule Providence;</hi> and what does he think of this Reverend Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor when appyl'd to Providence, to <hi>ſhackle) and confine Providence, that it ſhall not alter its uſual methods in the government of the World, or when it has diſpoſed of the Crown once, ſhall never be at liberty, while that Family laſts, to diſpoſe of it again to any other: what are theſe Laws, which he ſays are made by the Divine Authority, and are our Rule? They are the Laws of Succeſſion, which entail ehe Crown. And how does God ſettle the Crown on any Family by ſuch Laws? No otherwiſe but by his Providence.</hi> And <hi>an Hereditary King by Humane Entail, is as much a Providential King in reſpect of God, as the firſt of the Family; and to oppoſe the Laws of Entail, againſt God's ſetting up a new King by other Acts of his Providence, is to oppoſe Providence againſt Providence,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now the fallacy and weakneſs of theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are diſcovered from what was ſaid before, <hi>that Humane Laws are a Rule of Practice, and that Providence is no Rule of Practice:</hi> and therefore Providence is not to determine us againſt the Laws, but the Laws are to determine us againſt Providence: nor does it make any manner of difference in this, to ſay, that the Laws were made by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and the Poſſeſſion of the Throne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to theſe Laws, is by Providence likewiſe; and therefore to ſtand by the Entail againſt the Poſſeſſion, is to oppoſe a former to a latter Providence. For is there no difference between Providence concurring to the making and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing Laws, which are Rules of Practice, and ſo warranted by the Law of God, and the bare Acts or Permiſſions of Providence, which are no ſuch Rule, nor ſo warranted? So that (with the Drs. leave) the oppoſition is not between Providence, and Providence; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Rule, and no Rule: and (if we muſt ſpeak ſo) between Providence fixing a ſtated Rule, and the bare Acts of Providence, which are no Rule. And here is the plain fallacy of his Argument; it is true, the Laws of Entail were made by the Providence of God; but they do not receive their binding power, and oblige the Conſcience, from Providence, but from the Law of God. Providence concurred to the making them Laws, but the Law of God makes them obligatory. And therefore as meer Providence did not make them bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo neither does meer Providence deſtroy their obligation. And how extravagant does this Doctrine look, when apply'd to other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Legal Right? All the Laws of a Country are made by Providence, as well as the Entail of the Crown: And he that uſurp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>that private injuries are reſerv'd by God to the Redreſs of Publick Government</hi> does not reach the caſe; for beſides that injuries to Princes ore to be redreſs'd by the Laws, as well as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate injuries, and the Law is the Rule in one caſe as well as the other: the diſpute now is about oppoſing providence to providence, a former providence to a latter; and tho the Laws will diſpoſſeſs a providential Poſſeſſor (and ſo they will in all caſes if they might take place) Yet the Queſtion is, whether according to this Doctrine, the preſent wrongful Poſſeſſor, hath not the ſame Title with the firſt occupier or laſt Proprietor: For it is all but providence, the one hath it by the Law, that is by one Act of providence, the other hath it by Poſſeſſion, that is by another Act of providence. And Poſſeſſion is to preſcribe to the Law, as being the later providence, and not Law to the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, as being the former providence: And to talk of redreſſing injurious Poſſeſſion by the Law, is to redreſs providence by providence, a later providence by a former; and that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as abſurd, as to oppoſe providence againſt providence, a former Providence to a latter: <hi>For it is all but providence ſtill;</hi> And the Dr. <hi>deſires to know, why the providence of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail is more ſacred and obligatory, than any other act of providence, which gives a ſetled Poſſeſſion of the Throne.</hi>

               <hi>What follows</hi> (in my Anſwer) the Dr. tells us <hi>is pretty, and nothing more, The Land of</hi> Canaan <hi>was divided among the twelve Tribes by Gods expreſs command: And this</hi> (ſaith the Dr.) <hi>anſwers to Gods entailing the Crown, on the poſterity of</hi> David, <hi>the Poſſeſſion in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries is only by Providence, and this anſwers to a Humane Right and Title to the Crown, well</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is ſomething of likeneſs between them, and what then?</hi> and then repeats my words. <q>And therefore according to the Drs. way of reaſoning,<note place="margin">Poſtſcript. p. 11.</note> every man who wrongfully poſſeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of another mans eſtate in that Land <hi>(Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan)</hi> muſt be made to reſtore it, for God had expreſly given it to the other, and to his family. But in all other Countries, if a man by providence get his neighbours eſtate, he muſt have it, for the event is Gods Act, and 'tis his evident Decree and Counſel that he ſhould have it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this the Dr. replies; <hi>The fundamental miſtake, which runs through all thoſe kind of arguments is this, that they make the events of providence in private injuries, thefts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, to be the very ſame with God's diſpoſal of Kingdoms, and to have the ſame effects:</hi> Now whoſe arguments are theſe that make the events of providence the very ſame in both caſes? why truly the Drs. own, does he not tell us in his <hi>Caſe of Allegiance, that the Scripture never ſpeaks of God's bare permiſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

The Event of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation, and the Event of unjuſt Poſſeſſion differ as to the matter, but as to the Will, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, Order and Decree of God, they are both the ſame; for the Diſpoſſeſſion of a priva e man, is the ſame Providential Will, Order, Counſel and Decree, as the Diſpoſſeſſion of a King. And if this be a miſtake, then the Drs. Doctrine is a miſtake, and his <hi>Fundamental Doctrine</hi> is a <hi>Fundamental miſtake,</hi> and I cannot help that: And to mend the matter the Dr. hath gone one ſtep farther, <hi>and to have the ſame effects.</hi> And why not I pray? The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ground why Uſurpation is to take effect, and draw the Allegiance of the Subject after it, is becauſe it <hi>is God's Counſel, Decree and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi> And if theſe be the ſame in all other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents; why do not they take <hi>effect</hi> alſo, when the reaſon and ground is the very ſame? and I would fain ſee a good reaſon, why the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Counſels and Orders, are not as valid againſt the Legal Right to a private Eſtate, as the Legal Right to the Crown. The Doctrine of Providence affords us no difference, and God's Government equally extends to all Caſes and Perſons: The Scriptures give us none, but equally attribute the depreſſion and exaltation of private men to the Providence of God, as they do the ſetting up and pulling down Kings, and not one of the Drs. Arguments, ſo far as they concern Providence, but what are equally applicable to private property as to Thrones and Kingdoms: And let him diſprove this by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any one if he can. But the Dr. tells us that <hi>All private injuries are reſerved by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the correction, and redreſs of publick Government and Humane Courts of Juſtice; and therefore his providence has no effect at all on ſuch perſonal Rights.</hi> Now this is true, and a good reaſon why the providence of God does not take effect againſt Legal Rights. But how will this agree with the Drs. Doctrine and Argument? Does God reſerve the redreſs of theſe contrary to his own Decrees and Orders? Do ſuch reſervings exclude himſelf and his own interpoſitions by providence? <hi>When God has done this once, ſhall he never be at liberty to diſpoſe it otherwiſe, and will not the Dr. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Providence of God to change and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whatever reaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Dr. adds, <hi>But the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nature of the thing proves, that ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes which are too big for a Legal deciſion, or any Humane Courts, for the deciſion of which God has erected no univerſal Tribunal on Earth; he has reſerved to his own judgment, ſuch as the Correction of Sovereign Princes, and the transferring Kingdoms and Empires. And here the final determination of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in ſetling Princes on their Thrones, draws the Allegiance and Submiſſion of the Subjects after it, and in ſuch Caſes God does not confine himſelf to determine on the ſide of Humane Right, but acts with a Sovereign Authority, and gives the Kingdoms of the World to whom he pleaſe, as he can beſt ſerve the wiſe, and many times unſearchable deſigns of his providence by it.</hi> To this I anſwer, and becauſe he hath the ſame in other places, I ſhall do it diſtinctly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Rights of Princes may and ought to be determined by Law, as well as thoſe of Subjects. I have already inſtanced in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,</hi> where the Law hath decided the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, and the Caſe hath been the ſame in other Kingdoms; but I wonder whoever inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a Providential Title, or thought it a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient competition for a Legal Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty plain Caſe, that however ſome People may talk of it, no body believes it. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are no Judges and Juries appointed, and the Rights of Princes are not to be tryed in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall, nor in other Courts of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107829:49"/> Judicature; therefore Poſſeſſion and Providence muſt determine it: But this is manifeſtly falſe, for the Law is as proper a Judge of the Rights of Princes, as of any other; their Perſons are not under the Law, but their Titles are, and the Laws declare who is, and who is not King; as much as they do who is, or who is not any inferior Proprietor. And as to what the Dr. ſays of a <hi>Tribunal,</hi> I ſuppoſe he means to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force this upon the Subject, (for the matter is declared by the Law, and there needs no Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal for that, no more than there needs a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Judge of controverſies, in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, 'tis a duty under the direction of the Law, and every Perſon concerned is bound to take notice of it.) But as for the other, if the Law may take its courſe, there are <hi>Tribunals</hi> enough: But indeed when the Prince is diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, there is no Tribunal to force this, and to puniſh the neglect, that is, there is no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to hang a Man, if he does not take notice of the Law; and there is power to hang him if he does. This makes ſome difference as to puniſhment, but none as to duty, for the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation ariſes from the direction of the Law, and not from the external force to compel the obſervance, and the direction of the Law binds when there are, and when there are not Courts of Judicature to put it in execution.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is no Tribunal for the Correction of Princes but Gods:</hi> Very true! And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not accountable to the People for mal-adminiſtration; Their Perſons are ſacred, their Authority irreſiſtable and unalienable. And theſe were the Inferences, that hitherto the Men of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have drawn from this Doctrine; but the Dr. hath found out a new Inference, that the Subjects may reſiſt him, and ſhake off his Authority, and kill him too if need be; and all for this weighty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe they have put another in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his Throne: I know the Dr. calls it Providence, but that is the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis true God hath reſerved to himſelf the Correction of Sovereign Princes, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he doth here actually correct and puniſh them, and diſpoſſeſſion is ſometimes deſign'd as a Puniſhment by God himſelf. But ſtill the Queſtion returns, is ſuch a diſpoſſeſſion by providence a ſufficient evidence, that God hath given away the Kingdom from the diſpoſſeſſed to the Poſſeſſor of the Throne; and 'till that can be made out all theſe Arguments and Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences ſignifie nothing. And that is manifeſtly falſe in the Caſe of <hi>David,</hi> he for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſins was diſpoſſeſſed by his own Son; but God by that providence did not take away the Kingdom from <hi>David</hi> and give it to <hi>Abſolom:</hi> And God had then erected no Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Tribunal for the deciſion of ſuch Caſes, no more than he has now. The Queſtion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is not whether there are ſome Caſes too big for a Legal Deciſion or Humane Courts, or whether God hath reſerv'd to his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the correction of Princes, and transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Kingdoms: But the Queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Poſſeſſion of the Throne by providence diveſts the Rightful King of the Crown, and of the Allegiance of the Subjects, while his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is in being, and his Legal Right remains. And that the matters being reſerved to God's own Tribunal does not prove; the nature of the thing indeed proves that caſes that cannot be redreſſed by publick Government, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to God's own judgment; but their being ſo reſerved (which is the full of the Drs. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) does not prove, that therefore every Providential Poſſeſſion of the Throne, is God's final determination or any warrantable evidence to conclude from thence, that God hath made him a King, and the People his Subjects. Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> makes another Collection from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in this very caſe. <hi>No <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpations can extinguiſh the Right and Title of the natural Prince; ſuch <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers,</hi>

               <hi>the they have the Poſſeſſion of the ſupreme Power, yet they have no right to it; and tho God for wiſe reaſons may ſometimes permit ſuch <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations; yet while his</hi> Providence <hi>ſecures the Perſons of ſuch depoſed and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Princes from violence, he ſecures their Title too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Dr. ſays, that in correction of Princes and transferring Kingdoms, <hi>God does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine himſelf to determine on the ſide of humane Right, but acts with a Sovereign Authority, and gives the Kingdoms of the World to whom he pleaſes.</hi> And what then? and therefore the Poſſeſſion of the Throne by providence is God's giving the Kingdom, but that does not follow: And <hi>God's acting with a Sovereign
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107829:49"/> Authority</hi> (which the Dr. intimates as a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) does not prove it, for in all acts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, God acts with a <hi>Sovereign Authority</hi> if by <hi>Sovereign Authority</hi> the Dr. means act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing independantly, and without reſpect to the Laws and Rules God hath preſcribed to others. This is the ſame in caſes under the cognizance of Laws and Humane Courts, as well as in thoſe which are above them, and ſuch acting by a Sovereign Authority is no Rule for mankind, nor warrant for practice. But if by <hi>Gods act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a Sovereign Authority</hi> the Dr. means, That God as Lord and Proprietor of the World may diſpoſe of it as he ſees good, and actually does ſo in ſuch a way as may warrant practice, and confer a good Right and Title, as when he ordered the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to ſpoil the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> This was an Act of Sovereign Authority, but cannot be called Providence, but comes under the notion of a Law, and they were warranted to take the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> goods not from provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence giving them opportunity, but from God's expreſs will impowering and authorizing them ſo to do. In like manner God may if he pleaſe diſpoſe of Kingdoms, and private eſtates by his Sovereign Authority; but if he does ſo, he extinguiſhes the Legal Right of the former owner, and conveys it to whom he gives it. And it can never be concluded that he does ſo from providence only, the ends and deſigns of which are myſterious and to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, but from ſome further evidence and notice of the Divine Will: But the Dr. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds God's providence with his Laws, and makes one a Rule of practice as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. God governs the World by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as well as by his Laws, but he hath not made his providence, nor directed us to obſerve it as a Rule of life. And therefore the Drs. proof is prepoſterous, for although there are caſes reſerv'd to Gods own judgment; altho God may act by a Sovereign Authority, that is nothing to his purpoſe, except he proves like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that the events of providence are God's final ſentence; and that he would have the World take notice of them as ſuch. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that the Dr. is for beginning at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, and proves that God's providence is his final determination, and a Rule to be obſerved, becauſe there are Caſes reſerved to his own judgment: And therefore this proves indeed, that there is a difference in the two Caſes, but does not prove, that there is any difference in providence, which is the only thing that needs to be proved; the one is under publick Government, the other is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly under the Government of God, but they are both immediatly under Providence: And a direct anſwer muſt affect that, and ſhew how providence is leſs Gods Act, or a leſs Act of his Sovereign Authority, with reſpect to private Poſſeſſions than to Thrones; how the ſame Providence, which in one Caſe is Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to Laws, diſſolves their obligation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels the bond of Oaths, and diſpoſes Crowns, in the other does nothing at all, but is under the Authority of a <hi>Juſtice</hi> of Peace or a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable.</hi> But this (which is the main point) the Dr. does not attempt to anſwer, but inſtead of that tells us, that in one caſe, <hi>God hath erected humane Judicatures, but the other are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to his own judgment,</hi> i. e. there is ſome difference as to the things but none as to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which is the only queſtion: For a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Judicature does not alter the nature of Providence; and if providence be God's <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, Order, and Council,</hi> then it is ſo notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any humane Judicature; and it is ſomewhat ſtrange, that a humane Judicature ſhould determine againſt God's Orders, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees any more than humane Laws. And here I deſire to be reſolved in 2 Queſtions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How it comes to paſs, that a humane Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory is a greater confinement to Providence than a humane Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether God hath erected humane Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories to determine the Rights of private men, any otherwiſe, or for any other purpoſes than he hath humane Entails to determine the Rights of Kings; and if not, then I ſuppoſe it will follow, that as humane Judicatories are a Reaſon why <hi>Providence</hi> (as the Dr. ſays) <hi>has no effect at all on ſuch Perſonal Rights,</hi> ſo hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Entails alſo will be a Reaſon why provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has no effect at all on ſuch Regal Rights, or at leaſt the one will be as good a Reaſon as the other.</p>
            <p>At laſt the Dr. comes to prove his point from the <hi>Poet,</hi> and tells me, <hi>The</hi> Poet <hi>would have taught him the difference between theſe two Caſes:</hi> And I confeſs, I ſhould rather have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected this Doctrin in a <hi>Poet</hi> than in a <hi>Divine.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>Now the <hi>Poet</hi> is not for him neither, for all that he ſays (as the Dr. quotes him) is, that the Government of Kings is over their own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and the Government of <hi>Jupiter</hi> is over Kings themſelves. And that he might very well think without the Drs. notion of Providence; and what opinion the <hi>Poet</hi> had of Providence does not appear. But however, tho this is not for the Drs. Purpoſe, it muſt be own'd, that the Method is very proper; for proofs from a <hi>Poet</hi> do very well ſuit with <hi>Poetical Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dr. goes on; <hi>Beſides ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Principles,<note place="margin">P. 47.</note> Kings muſt be throughly ſetled in their Governments, before it becomes unlawful for Subjects to diſpoſſeſs them; and then if he will make the Caſes parallel, be who unjuſtly ſeizes another mans eſtate, muſt be throughly ſetled in it, before it becomes unlawful to diſpoſſeſs him, but that no private man can be, who is under the Government of Laws, who has not the Poſſeſſion of his Eſtate given him by Law; and when he has, whether right or wrong, he muſt not be violently diſpoſſeſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi> Now I crave the Drs. good leave, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn him one of his own Complements, is he in <hi>

                  </gap>eſt,</hi> or in earneſt? and certainly ſuch things as theſe were never ſaid in <hi>earneſt</hi> by a man of the Drs. Character. The diſpute is between the Providential Poſſeſſion of the Throne, and of a private Eſtate, now to make the <hi>Caſes paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel,</hi> in the private Caſe there muſt be a <hi>Legal</hi> Poſſeſſion; that is there is a Parallel between Poſſeſſion and Poſſeſſion, but between <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential</hi> and <hi>Legal,</hi> which is the only thing in controverſie, there is none. We are not now diſputing about the notion of a <hi>thorough Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement;</hi> and for once let us take it in the Drs. ſenſe, and ſee what a fine <hi>Parallel</hi> he makes, a thorough Settlement of an Uſurper on the Throne, is an actual and viſible Settlement, not a Legal one; the Settlement of a private Perſon in an eſtate, is a Legal Settlement; and to make the Caſes <hi>Parallel,</hi> one muſt be <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> ſetled, not <hi>legally,</hi> and the other muſt be <hi>legally</hi> ſetled: And ſo a thorough Settlement in one ſenſe, is <hi>Parallel</hi> to a thorough Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in another ſenſe; even juſt as a <hi>Tryal</hi> of skill, is <hi>Parallel</hi> to a <hi>Tryal</hi> at Law, or the Drs.

But <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel</hi> is a term in <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> as Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a term in <hi>Law.</hi> But when they come to be apply'd to Uſurpation, they muſt change their ſignification, and mean the clean contrary. And there is all the reaſon in the World, for if Uſurper ſignifies a King, why may not Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſignifie Illegal Poſſeſſion, and <hi>Parallel</hi> ſignifie inequality? Now 'tis no marvel the Dr. tells his Anſwerer, <hi>he expects to hear no more from him;</hi> for who is able to anſwer ſuch terrible arguments as theſe?</p>
            <p>The Dr. here tells us, that <hi>by his Principles Kings muſt be throughly ſetled in their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments before it becomes unlawful for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to diſpoſſeſs them:</hi> Now I cannot tell what his Principles are, but this I can tell, that his Arguments prove no ſuch thing.

But the truth is the Drs. notion of a thorough Settlement, hath rooted up the very foundations of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and plainly center in the Commonwealth Principles. And that is the bottom of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and for the proof of this I will be tryed by the Dr. himſelf. In his <hi>Caſe of Allegiance</hi> diſputing againſt a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Right,<note place="margin">p. 25.</note> he thus delivers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: <hi>To ſay that God ſets up no Prince, who aſcends the Throne without a humane and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Right, is to ſay that the Right of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not derived from God without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the People; for if God can't make a King without their conſent declared by their Laws,</hi> (and if the Dr. will give me leave, I ſay without their conſent declared by themſelves, or the States, or the great body of the Nation) <hi>the Authority muſt be derived from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not from God, or at leaſt if it be God's Authority; yet God cannot give it himſelf without the People, nor otherwiſe than as they have directed him by their Laws:</hi> I add by their conſent; But what becomes of the Drs. thorough Settlement <hi>by the Conſent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> all this while, why it may be, he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got it: But however he tells us, that it is his Principle, and that may be too; but hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men uſed to bring Arguments to prove, and not to confute their Principles.</p>
            <p>The Dr. goes on, <hi>as our Author has ſtated the caſe, it ſignifies nothing to the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for whether private mens eſtates be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a Divine or Humane Entail, it is the ſame caſe if they ſuffer injury from their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Subjects, they muſt ſeek for redreſs from Publick Government.</hi> That is, the ſaying, that the Land of <hi>Judah</hi> was entailed by a Divine Entail, as well as the Crown, is not to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe, tho the great ſtreſs of the Drs. Anſwer lies in the difference between a Divine and a Humane Entail And it is plain enough from thence, that a Divine Entail made no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as to <hi>Providence</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> between that and other Nations: But his reaſon is that private injuries may be redreſſed by publick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; well! and that is a reaſon to prove that no providential diſpoſſeſſion of a private man, is any warrant againſt Law. But it is no reaſon to prove, that a providential diſpoſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Prince is ſuch a warrant, but the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for being above or under the Law makes no alteration in the nature of Providence; and it is odd to ſay, that Providence has power and efficacy in Caſes where the Law has none, but has none where it has. But this hath been conſidered before; and as to the matter of God's ſetling the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> by Divine Entail: The Dr. after having ſaid, that <hi>he could have told me, how to have applied the Caſe to the purpoſe,</hi> (and methinks he that hath ſaid ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the purpoſe, need not have neglected what had been to his purpoſe) ſhews ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> and other Countries: But thoſe are not at all to <hi>his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Canaan</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>where God allotted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very tribe and family their inheritance, none could pretend to a Right to any portion of Land, but what was allotted him. But in other Countries which were left in Common, Poſſeſſion and Occupation gave a Right:</hi> Very true, but not when they were not left in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but property was incloſed by Laws, Legal Poſſeſſion then only gave a Right. But ſaith he, <hi>Thus in</hi> Judah <hi>none had an ordinary Right to the Crown, but thoſe that were nominated by God, or had the Crown deſcended on them by a Divine Entail. But in other Countries Poſſeſſion and Occupation gave a Right to the Allegiance of Subjects.</hi> Now if the Dr. would have made this Parallel he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>in other Countries, where Government was left in Common;</hi> and then it had been true enough, for no body had a better Right; but it is not ſo, where the Crown is entail'd by Laws, Poſſeſſion gives no more Right to the Crown, than it gives to private Eſtates.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Canaan</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when God had ſetled ſuch an inheritance in a family, it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be perpetually alienated, and tho it were ſold, it could be ſold for no longer time than till the year of</hi> Jubilee, <hi>when all eſtates were to return to their old Proprietors again.</hi> Right; and this was the Law of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and by virtue of that they did ſo return, but had there been no ſuch Law, would the Land-once ſold, have
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107829:51"/> then by virtue merely of a Divine Entail, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to their old Proprietors? <hi>But in other Countries men may part with their Eſtates for ever:</hi> Right again, becauſe the Laws permit them ſo to do: But if the Laws of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, had provided that all Eſtates ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their old Proprietors at ſuch a year, they would have done ſo too, tho the Proviſion had been made only by a Humane Law. <hi>Thus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the Kingdom of</hi> Judah, <hi>tho God by his Sovereign Authority might ſet up a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential King, yet this did not cut off the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail; but whenever the true Heir, appeared, Subjects if they were at Liberty, were bound to make him King, and diſpoſſeſs the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper; but in other Kingdoms, a Kingdom may be loſt, as well as an inheritance ſold for ever. Thus</hi> that is juſt as an Eſtate in <hi>Judah</hi> and other Countries, might or might not be ſold, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of each Country; in like manner, as in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Crown was not alienable, tho the Eſtates for a time were, even ſo, <hi>in other Kingdoms a Kingdom may be loſt, as well as an inheritance ſold for ever.</hi> And that is to ſay again, that as in other Kingdoms an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance may be ſold by the conſent of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties intereſſed, even ſo a Government may be loſt, without, and contrary to the conſent of the Proprietor, and right owner. For ſuch Parallels as theſe, <hi>otherwiſe</hi> or <hi>quite contrary</hi> might have ſerved, as well as <hi>Thus;</hi> The Dr. tells me what I ſay in this Caſe is <hi>pretty,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that between the Divine Entail, and Gods expreſs command concerning <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Poſſeſſion by providence and a Humane En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail there is <hi>ſome likeneſs.</hi> I am ſorry I cannot return all his Complement, this is very <hi>pretty</hi> indeed, but there is no <hi>likeneſs</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>We are come to the Drs. Anſwer to the objection,<note place="margin">P. 48.</note> 
               <hi>that the Laws of the Land are the meaſure of duty, and Rule of Conſcience,</hi> &amp;c. and the ſum of the Anſwer is, <hi>they are ſo, when they do not contradict the Laws of God, but when they do they are no Rule, but their obligation muſt give place to Divine Authority, and ſuppoſe the Law ſhould forbid owning any King, but the Right Heir; and the Law of God ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand obedience to him, that actually poſſeſſes the Throne we muſt obey the Law of God.</hi> To this I anſwered, <q>where is this Law of God,<note place="margin">Poſtſcript. p. 11.</note> that commands us to obey Uſurpers? where is it affirm'd in expreſs terms, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from thence by evident conſequence?</q> He replies, <hi>he hath ſhewed it before, and it is in his book ſtill and there I may ſee it.</hi> As if I had not at all conſider'd, what he had ſaid in his Book in my Anſwer. But to ſay, that he would examine that preſently would not have been ſo ſharp, nor half ſo magiſterial, as to ſay <hi>it is in my book ſtill, and there he may find it.</hi> But by his favour, I cannot find that he hath ſhewed it, either in his former, or in his new book, and that he hath only ſaid it, but not ſhewed it, will appear preſently. But I had ſaid, that <hi>this Law had need be very clear and evident, and the Dr. had need be very ſure of it, when he builds not only his Book, but his practice upon it, in plain contradiction (by his own confeſſion) to the Laws of the Land:</hi> He replies, <hi>I never confeſſed this was contrary to the Laws of the Land; but on the contrary, that the Laws of the Land, if we will believe learned Judges and Lawyers, do allow and juſtifie it.</hi> I don't know what he means by <hi>confeſſing,</hi> but if to maintain, that a Perſon poſſeſſed of the Throne <hi>contrary to Law</hi> is to be owned and obeyed as King; if to write a Book in juſtification of that Doctrine, and to call that Book his Reaſons, be to <hi>confeſs</hi> it; then the Dr. hath <hi>confeſſed</hi> it to the purpoſe. And I don't know how I ſhould prove this, except I ſhould reprint his <hi>Caſe of Allegiance,</hi> with a new Title, and call it his <hi>Confeſſions.</hi> For there is not a page nor an argument but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes it, bating only ſome part of the Anſwer to this objection: But the objection it ſelf, and the firſt anſwer as plainly confeſs it as words can do. The ground of the objection is, that it is <hi>contrary to the Laws of the Land,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contrary to our duty; and the ſubſtance of the Anſwer is, that <hi>what he hath ſaid</hi> i. e. what he had ſaid before concerning Providence and Uſurped Powers <hi>is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it,</hi> And it is ſo, <hi>when the Laws do not contradict the Laws of God:</hi> And yet he <hi>never confeſſed</hi> it; and all for this poor ſhift, becauſe, in anſwer to an objection, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond anſwer too, Foreign to his whole Book; he had ſaid, that according to the opinion of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107829:51"/> Learned Judges and Lawyers, the Laws do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; now the Queſtion is, whether his <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi> or his Arguments to prove it, proceed upon any ſuch allowance, or have any manner of reſpect to it. And I wonder what the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of providence as he handles it, has to do with his opinion of <hi>Judges and Lawyers,</hi> or the <hi>Laws</hi> themſelves; for he debates the matter in direct oppoſition and contradiction to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws. And to ſay he never confeſſed what is the ſubject matter, the whole ſcope and drift of his Book; becauſe <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> and what does not in the leaſt relate to his <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi> he had mention'd the Judges and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers for the Laws, is a mean Evaſion; and (if the Dr. likes his own words better) <hi>a childiſh piece of Sophiſtry, and argues great contempt of his Readers.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 43.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Dr. tells us, (as to the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this Law commanding obedience to Uſurpers) <hi>That the Scripture is plain in the Caſe, and that he is pretty ſure of it: But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he proves the Scripture cannot be clear in the point,</hi> my Words are [that it is not clear is evident not only] <hi>from the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies about it, in the late diſmal times of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation, that</hi> (ſaith the Dr.) <hi>is to ſay, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be clear in Scripture which is matter of controverſie, and thus we muſt either be Scepticks in Religion, or ſeek for an infallible interpreter. Thus Hereticks oppoſe the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith: Thus Papiſts diſpute againſt the Scriptures being a Rule of Faith. And whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe arguments will carry our Author, I cannot tell, but they look very kindly towards</hi> Rome; <hi>and if that be his inclination, I can pardon his</hi> zeal <hi>in this Cauſe;</hi> what, and is Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> come to take up with theſe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and ſcandalous arts to hunt his Adverſaries by a cry of Popery? I perceive the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples will always have the ſame practices. This is indeed very ſpightful, but it is withal very ridiculous; the Dr. does not deny, but tho he was not <hi>factious,</hi> yet he <hi>was hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and</hi> zealous <hi>againſt taking the Oaths;</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 79.</note> and had he at that time any kind <hi>inclinations</hi> towards <hi>Rome?</hi> But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice is fooliſh, and that is anſwer enough to ſuch <hi>charitable inuendo's:</hi> Well? <hi>But thus Papiſts diſpute againſt the Scriptures being a Rule of Faith.</hi> And what if they do? and therefore whoever diſputes thus againſt the Scriptures, not being clear in a particular Text, <hi>looks very kindly towards</hi> Rome: An admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſequence! As if there was no difference between concluding, that the Scriptures are not clear from the controverſies about them; and therefore are not a Rule of Faith, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from a particular controverſie, that the Scriptures are not clear in a particular point. And I hope a man may think a particular Text obſcure, and may collect it from the diſputes of learned men about it, without any great fear of running into <hi>Scepticiſm</hi> or <hi>infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> But be that as it will, it is not the Caſe here, and the Dr. does not fairly repreſent my words or meaning: For I never ſaid, <hi>The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures cannot be clear in the point,</hi> for I think they are clear enough to any unprejudiced man. But all that I ſaid was, <hi>That it is not clear that there is ſuch a Law of God,</hi> That is, it is not clear, that the Drs. ſenſe is the ſenſe of Scripture, and I hope there is ſome difference between ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture is not clear, and ſaying his ſenſe of it is not clear: So that (if the Dr. pleaſe) the Queſtion is not whether the Scripture be <hi>clear</hi> in the point, but whether the ſenſe he hath given of it be <hi>clear.</hi> And that it is not I ſaid, <hi>is evident not only from the controverſies about it in the late times of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation,</hi> but, &amp;c. which the Dr. thus expounds, <hi>That is to ſay, nothing can be clear in Scripture, which is matter of controverſie;</hi> that is to ſay, the Dr. expounds away my meaning, and then diſputes againſt his own expoſition, for I believe that the contrary to what the Dr. aſſerts is clear in Scripture; tho Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> and Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> have <hi>controverted</hi> it, and I think it is not the leſs <hi>clear</hi> for any thing they both have ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. But I think likewiſe, that the ſenſe ſome men give of Scripture, and particularly the ſenſe the ſaid two Drs. have given of the 13 to the <hi>Romans,</hi> &amp;c. is not clear; and that it is not ſo, may be <hi>evident from the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies about it,</hi> which I did not expreſs ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, much leſs with an univerſal negative as the Dr. expounds it, but with limitation to a particular time and occaſion, in the <hi>late times of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation;</hi> for tho it cannot be ſaid that <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is clear which is matter of controverſie;</hi> yet it may be ſaid that ſomething is <hi>not clear</hi> which is matter of controverſie, and it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107829:52"/> not to be clear, not merely from its being controverted, but from that joyn'd with ſome other circumſtances, as is the Caſe; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie about it <hi>in the late times,</hi> may be an evidence that it is not clear, tho the bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie about it may not.</p>
            <p>And let any man conſider the ſtate of this Controverſie in thoſe times, and the Parties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it, and he may eaſily be ſatisfied. Now the Drs. <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> and Arguments were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by thoſe Advocates for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation,</hi> with all art and skill, and as much to advantage as the Dr. himſelf hath done: (And if the Dr. doubts of this, I will upon his requeſt make it good by enumeration of particulars,) and it muſt be confeſſed, that that was a fit ſeaſon to examine into this Doctrine; and the members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> were at that time as judicious and learned for their intellectuals, and as pious and ſincere for their morals as any age hath bred. And that which gives a luſtre to their virtues, and recommends to the World, not only their memories and practices, but their Doctrines alſo (as far as a meer humane exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can recommend them) is that (after the example of their glorious Sovereign) they were all <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> and ſome of them <hi>Martyrs</hi> for the Doctrine of the Church, and the Laws of the Land. And theſe were the men that held the other ſide of the Queſtion: And of this very caſe it is that the Dr. ſpeaks ſo contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and ſcornfully: <hi>That is to ſay nothing can be clear in Scripture which is matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,</hi> as if there was no difference between a bare controverſie, and a controverſie in theſe circumſtances; for this I plainly refer to, and it is next to impoſſible that the Dr. ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand me otherwiſe; for what can I poſſibly mean by the controverſies about this Doctrine in the <hi>late times?</hi> but what was manag'd by the <hi>Regicides,</hi> and their Abettors, on the one ſide, and if the Dr. pleaſe on his ſide of the Queſtion; and on the other by the Loyal and Excellent members of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And I wonder what he means by being <hi>clear,</hi> is that clear which appears, or is pretended to appear only to men of vitious and corrupt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and for corrupt ends (I ſpeak here of the late times) and does not appear, nor can be ſeen, by men of the greateſt integrity and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities? And this is plainly the Caſe, and let the Dr. if he can ſhew me any one Perſon (when this controverſie was at the heighth) who own'd his Hypotheſis, who was not likewiſe very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in his Principles relating to Government, or on the other hand, any one Perſon, who was of true Principles, and of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that embraced this Doctrine or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, or who did not (as far as appears) perfectly and in expreſs terms diſown and abhor it. And this I think if the byaſs be not very great, may eaſily ſatisfie any man, that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies in the late times</hi> about this Doctrin, are a ſufficient evidence that ſuch a ſenſe as the Dr. contends for, is not very <hi>clear,</hi> except a man is reſolved to call that <hi>clear</hi> which no body can ſee but himſelf. And this plainly ſhews the inconſequence of his Inferences. <hi>Thus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Hereticks oppoſe the Articles of Faith;</hi> Yes juſt thus, that is, they produce all the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox</hi> plainly and clearly determining on their ſide; <hi>Thus Papiſts diſpute againſt the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures being a Rule of Faith:</hi> That is by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when that controverſie was in debate, that all and every one of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> gave their judgments, that the Scripture was no Rule of Faith.</p>
            <p>I added to ſhew the Drs. ſenſe was not clear: That <hi>no learned men could ever eſpy this Law before the times of</hi> John Goodwin. To this he replies, <hi>what does he think of Mr.</hi> Calvin <hi>and</hi> Grotius, <hi>who have both paſſed for learned men? And they eſpyed this Law before</hi> John Goodwin. Now I expected the Dr. would have produced <hi>one</hi> at leaſt of the Church of <hi>England</hi> on his ſide; but ſuch a one it ſeems was not to be found, and therefore he gives us two Forreigners, both learned men indeed, but againſt one there is juſt exception, and the other is not for him. Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> for any thing I know may be of the Drs. opinion; and any man that conſiders the turbulent State of <hi>Geneva</hi> at that time, and the Revolution there, will be able to give a Reaſon for it, and I think there is no great Queſtion, but as he ſuited his Church Diſcipline, ſo he did his Doctrines about Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to the circumſtances of that State. And his Doctrine of a power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to inferior Magiſtrates,<note place="margin">

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:107829:52"/> to ſay no more, the Judgment of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in point of Government hath always been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded by the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and it is a great evidence the Dr. is very much ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for Authors when no body but Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> can be found to concur with him. He might if he had pleas'd have nam'd Dr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and it would have done as well.

            <p>And here by the way we have not only the ſenſe of <hi>Grotius,</hi> but a very good Argument likewiſe; for if in real Contracts made with a King, as ſuſtaining the perſon of a ſupreme Governour, if theſe bound to his perſon out or Poſſeſſion, and not to the Uſurper in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, it is plain the Prince out of Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the King, and the Uſurper is none; for the Contract or League was made with him as King of ſuch a Country, and if he ceaſes to be King, the binding power of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ceaſes as to him; for as the Dr. phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it, <hi>the Man is in being, but the King is gone,</hi> and the Contract goes away with it, and being <hi>real</hi> and not <hi>perſonal,</hi> paſſes to him that is King.

            <p>The Dr. proceeds, <hi>I grant indeed that the reſolution of Conſcience ought not to depend on ſuch niceties of Law and Hiſtory as learned men cannot agree about, and that is the reaſon why legal Rights and Titles are not to be a rule and meaſure of our Obedience to Princes, who are poſſeſs'd of the Throne. But is this a reaſon to reject the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Scripture too becauſe ſome men will diſpute the plaineſt Texts.</hi> Now ſaith the Dr. <hi>This hath nothing elſe but</hi> Scepticiſm <hi>or</hi> Infallibility <hi>at the bottom;</hi> yes by all means, To ſay that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's ſenſe is not clear becauſe no learned man eſpous'd it but himſelf, or to ſay that a little private Opinion, ſet on foot for the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt purpoſes within our memory, is not ſo <hi>clear</hi> as the concurrent judgment of all learned men; <hi>This,</hi> it ſeems, <hi>has nothing but</hi> Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm <hi>or</hi> Infallibility <hi>at the bottom.</hi> And this a man gets by dealing modeſtly with ſome men. Had I ſaid the Doctor's Expoſition had been abſurd and ridiculous, contrary to the ſenſe of all the learned, all would have been well, and the Dr. muſt have prov'd the contrary as well as he could; but when I only ſay it is not <hi>clear</hi> for the ſame reaſon, This is <hi>Scepticiſm</hi> and <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and I cannot tell what. And ſee how finely he expreſſes it. <hi>Is this a reaſon to reject the directions of Scripture, becauſe ſome men will diſpute the plaineſt Texts?</hi> And who I pray are theſe <hi>ſome men?</hi> Why (to confine our ſelves within our memories) Archbiſhop <hi>Ferne,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and all the reſt of the loyal Sufferers for King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Second.</hi> And if I may have leave to add a later inſtance, a little while ago Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> himſelf.

Now my Anſwer was this,<note place="margin">Poſtſcript p. 12.</note> 
               <q>Theſe (the Expreſſions of the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi>) are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true but nothing to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for God did always ſet up and remove Kings; but this was no evidence that God would have Uſurpers obey'd as Kings, as is evident in the caſe of <hi>Athaliah.</hi> And God did as much remove and ſet up Kings in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> as in any other Kingdom; and therefore it cannot from theſe Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be neceſſarily concluded, That every perſon that gets poſſeſſion of the Throne is a King, and ought to have the duties belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a King paid to him.</q> And is this no more than ſaying an Uſurper is no King? or need the Dr. be told wherein the force of this Anſwer lies? which is, That theſe Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are no Evidence that every perſon poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd of the Throne is a King, or that God would have them obey'd as Kings: and that is not (as the Dr. is pleaſed to ſay) only that an Uſurper is no King, but that which the Dr. cites to prove his Hypotheſis, does not prove it, and the reaſon of that is, for that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Daniel</hi> delivers a general Doctrine not peculiar to Times and Seaſons, or Countries, but what was always ſo, and <hi>God gives King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to whomſoever he will, and removeth and ſetteth up Kings</hi> in all Ages and Places, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107829:54"/> in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> as well as any other Kingdom. Now if this general Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine did not prove that God had given the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> to every one that poſſeſs'd the Throne and took it away from him that was diſpoſſeſſed, if it did not prove in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, that God had given it to <hi>Athaliah</hi> and took it away from <hi>Joaſh,</hi> then it is as clear as the Sun, that it cannot neceſſarily be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from this paſſage in <hi>Daniel,</hi> that Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Throne is an evidence that God gives, and Diſpoſſeſſion an evidence that God takes away the Kingdom; for God gave King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, remov'd and ſet up Kings, as much with reſpect to the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> as to any other Country. But this it ſeems is no Anſwer, and yet: however it comes to paſs) it anſwers all that the Dr. hath reply'd, as we ſhall ſee preſently. Well but I ſaid <hi>that Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were no Kings;</hi> I did ſo, and I thought I had given a good reaſon for it, and that is, <hi>That all learned men deny that an Uſurper is a King.</hi> But that it ſeems is no Reaſon with the Dr. Let all <hi>learned men,</hi> or all the world ſay what they will, if it does not ſerve the Doctor's tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Certainly proofs are mighty ſcarce when ſcraps of <hi>Poets</hi> and the derivation of Words are brought for proofs, <hi>Doctor à docen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi> and therefore every man that teaches is a <hi>Doctor.</hi> And yet S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> muſt be quoted for this too, and the <hi>Book</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> punctually on the Margin. He might as well have cited <hi>Calepin</hi> or <hi>Robert Stephens,</hi> and their Authority in ſuch caſuiſtical points as theſe, would have been a little more than S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s: however he goes on, and tells us <hi>it is certain,</hi> i. e. the Dr. confidently affirms it, tho he does not prove it, that <hi>he who has the exerciſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Power and Authority is King whether we will call him ſo or no; and he is no King who has no Regal Power, whatever his Title be.</hi> i. e. <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> was a King, tho he was not call'd ſo; and King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> the firſt twelve years of his Reign, was no King, tho he was call'd ſo. And this makes our Laws <hi>Nonſenſe</hi> with a witneſs, which own him as King all the time of the Uſurpation; and yet the Dr. adds, <hi>If this be not ſo</hi> (i. e. his propoſition before) <hi>our Laws are Nonſenſe, which diſtinguiſh between a King</hi> de jure <hi>and</hi> de facto, <hi>if a King</hi> de fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto <hi>be no King, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And the Law it ſelf,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. cap. 1.</note> where this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is made, plainly expounds what is meant by a King <hi>de facto</hi> by calling the ſame Perſons moſt commonly <hi>pretenced</hi> Kings, <hi>i. e.</hi> Perſons who had that name, but in reality were no Kings at all: And a <hi>pretenced</hi> King is no more a King than a Hypocrite is a Chriſtian, he is one in name and ſhew, but in reality no ſuch thing.

Now as for ſetting up rightful Kings, our Author likes it very well, but how does be like pulling down rightful Kings, which is as much againſt Law and Right, as to ſet up Kings without Right? and that it ſeems he does.</hi> Very well, and ſo he does; and does this contradict any thing that I have aſſerted? God removed <hi>Saul</hi> and ſet up <hi>David;</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd <hi>Joram</hi> and ſet up <hi>Jehu;</hi> he removed <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> and ſet up <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and all rightful Kings: and where is the harm or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107829:55"/> of this? The Dr. ſays, <hi>that to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile it to our Author's Hypotheſis, the removed King muſt ſignifie an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper; and the King ſet up, a Rightful and Legal King.</hi> Now if the Dr. can make this out from my <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> I will give him the Cauſe. He tells me, <hi>He doubts not, but our Author would be aſham'd to ſay this.</hi> And he is in the right: I ſhould be aſham'd to ſay that, and a great many other things too: but it ſeems he is not <hi>aſham'd</hi> to charge that upon my Hypotheſis, which is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contradiction to it. My Hypotheſis, as he repeats it, and diſputes againſt it, is, that <hi>an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper is no King;</hi> and therefore the Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a King, cannot, according to that <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,</hi> ſignifie the Removing an Uſurper, but of a Rightful King, <hi>i. e.</hi> a true King, not a pretended one: but then I think it follows, that the ſetting up of Kings, muſt ſignifie the ſetting up of true Kings likewiſe, and not U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers, who are not Kings. And this I do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon (and it is not a ſtrife about words) and let the Dr. prove if he can, that an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> is a <hi>King,</hi> either in the ſenſe of Scripture, or in any good Author, or by the general conſent of mankind. And if he cannot, then for him to interpret what the Scripture ſays of Kings, in favor of Uſurpers, is purely arbitrary; and he may as well apply the Directions and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Scripture concerning Husbands, to him that commits a Rape; For an Uſurper is no more a King, than a Raviſher is a Husband. And here is the plain ſtate of the Caſe, The Scripture aſſerts (and if the Scripture had been ſilent, the Doctrine of Providence ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evidences) that <hi>God removes Kings, and ſets up Kings.</hi> And this proves, that what Kings are remov'd, they are remov'd by God, and what Kings are ſet up, they are ſet up by God: But this does not prove that thoſe are Kings, which are not Kings, or that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers</hi> are within the intention of thoſe words, or that every Providential Diſpoſſeſſion, is God's unmaking a King, or every Providential Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Throne, is God's making a King; for this was manifeſtly otherwiſe in the Caſe of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abſalom, Joaſh</hi> and <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> and if the Dr. pleaſe, in the Caſe of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second and <hi>Cromwell.</hi> And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his Anſwer the Dr. had before, if he would but have minded it. <q>However when Perſons have Poſſeſſion of the Throne,<note place="margin">Poſtſcript, p. 12.</note> who have a Legal Title, either by Deſcent, or other Acquiſition, and <hi>who are Kings by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all mankind,</hi> it is plain that God ſets them up: And it cannot <hi>neceſſarily</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that any more is meant by <hi>God's ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up Kings;</hi> and if it cannot <hi>neceſſarily</hi> be concluded, then there is not from thence any ſufficient warrant to call every <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper</hi> God's King, and to pay Duties to them accordingly.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this is evidently the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's meaning, to attribute all the Changes and Revolutions of Government, not to Chance or Fate, but to the Divine Providence:</hi> Well, this is true enough, whether the Prophet meant it or no. The Dr. adds, <hi>That whenever we ſee one King removed, and another ſet up, whoever they be, they are removed and ſet up by God.</hi> And this is true enough, as the words lye; but in the Drs. ſenſe it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly falſe; for the people ſaw <hi>David</hi> remov'd, and it was by God alſo; but God by that Removal, did not give away his Kingdom; they ſaw <hi>Abſolom</hi> ſet up too, and this alſo (in a ſenſe) was by God, but God by that ſetting up, did not make him a King, and give him the Kingdom. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who</hi> (God) <hi>ruleth in the Kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will. Does</hi> whomſoever <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie thoſe only, who have a Legal Right? Does giving, ſuppoſe an antecedent right in him, to whom it is given? Does</hi> giving it to whomſoever he will, <hi>ſignifie giving it only to thoſe, whom the Laws give it? Do we uſe to ſay, a man may give his Eſtate to whom he will, when his Eſtate is entail'd, and he cannot alienate it from the Right Heir? we ſhould think this a very abſurd way of ſpeaking among men? and yet thus our Author muſt expound God's giving a Kingdom to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he will, to ſignifie his giving the Kingdom to the Right Heir.</hi> Now here are as many <hi>Sophiſms,</hi> as there are lines: and firſt of all, I do readily acknowledge, that <hi>whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever</hi> does not ſignifie thoſe only who have a Legal Right; but the fallacy is evident: for God gives all the World, as well as Crowns, to <hi>whomſoever</hi> he will. But for all that, no body
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107829:56"/> hath a right to private Eſtates but by the Laws of the Land. And it would be a fine Plea, in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> to argue upon God's Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Providence; Another man hath a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Title, but God gives the World to <hi>whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he will;</hi> and tho he hath no Legal Title, what then? Does <hi>whomſoever,</hi> ſignifie thoſe only who have a Legal Title? Thus likewiſe <hi>giving,</hi> in the notion of it, does not ſuppoſe an antecedent Right, but with reſpect to God's giving, and a Right by Humane Laws it does: for God gives Property to them, who have ſuch a Right; and he does not give it them who have no ſuch Right, tho they may poſſeſs it by fraud and injuſtice. But here the fallacy lys in dividing what ought not to be divided: for what is given by juſt Laws, God gives; and the antecedent Right is the Gift of God; and what God gives by Laws, which he hath made a Rule, is not to be defeated by Providence, which he hath not made a Rule. He asks again, <hi>Does</hi> giving to whomſoever he will, <hi>ſignifie giving it only to thoſe to whom the Law gives it?</hi> I anſwer no; it does not ſignifie ſo; neither does it ſignifie <hi>Poſſeſſion only.</hi> But this I can tell him, it ſignifies every jot as much ſo in Kingdoms and Governments, as it does in private Poſſeſſions and Eſtates. And the Propoſition in Scripture is as univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, that God gives every thing, all the Profits, Honors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the World, to <hi>whomſoever he will:</hi> or if it was not in Scripture, it is a Doctrine plain enough; and every man that owns Providence muſt own it. And it is a pure conſequence, that every man who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly poſſeſſed of an Eſtate, hath a Divine Right to it, tho not a Legal one; becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth <hi>giving it to whomſoever he will, does not ſignifie, giving it only to thoſe to whom the Law gives it.</hi> It is in vain here for the Dr. to anſwer as he does often in his <hi>Vindication,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 58.</note> That thoſe <hi>matters are refer'd to the Redreſs of publick Laws; but theſe God reſerves to his own cognizance and diſpoſal.</hi> For the Queſtion here, is about the importance and ſignification of theſe Expreſſions. And here his Queſtions turn upon him; Does <hi>whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi> ſignifie thoſe only, who are redreſs'd by <hi>Publick Laws?</hi> Does <hi>giving</hi> ſignifie only a Sentence of a Judg, or the Verdict of a Jury? Does <hi>giving to whomſoever he will, ſignifie giving it only to thoſe, to whom the Law gives it?</hi> And if they do ſignifie ſo, then his Queſtions are vain; if they do not, then his Argument is vain, and there is nothing to be concluded from theſe Expreſſions for the Drs. purpoſe: for they are equally affirm'd in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and equally true of private Eſtates, as of Governments. The Expreſſion is the ſame, and the Latitude is the ſame in both Caſes: He that gives Crowns, and that gives Eſtates to <hi>whomſoever he will,</hi> equally gives them to <hi>whomſoever he will.</hi> And what difference ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is between Thrones and private Eſtates, between matters above Humane Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals, and ſuch as are ſubject to them, there is none at all in <hi>giving them to whomſoever he will.</hi> And if it be a good Argument for Poſſeſſion againſt Legal Right, that <hi>God gives to whomſoever he will,</hi> then 'tis likewiſe a good Argument in all caſes: for God gives to <hi>whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever</hi> he will in one caſe, as well as the other. And <hi>whomſoever</hi> and <hi>giving;</hi> and <hi>giving to whomſoever God will,</hi> ſignifie the very ſame in both caſes; <hi>whomſoever</hi> no more <hi>ſignifies thoſe who have a Legal Right,</hi> nor <hi>giving, an antecedent Right in him to whom it is given,</hi> nor <hi>giving to whomſoever he will, giving it only to thoſe to whom the Law gives it,</hi> with reſpect to private Eſtates, than it does to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments. And if it cannot be concluded from ſuch a <hi>ſignification,</hi> that a wrongful poſſeſſion againſt Law, is God's gift, and ought to be own'd as ſuch, the Drs. Argument from ſuch a <hi>ſignification,</hi> is trifling and falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. And that is the only thing in queſtion. And the truth is, ſuch kind of Arguments prove nothing. For the Propoſition in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that God gives Kingdoms, and that he gives Riches and private Eſtates to <hi>whomſoever he will,</hi> is deny'd by no body that believes a God and Providence. And that is not the Queſtion; but the Queſtion is, whether a Providential Poſſeſſion againſt Legal Right, be a ſuffient Evidence of <hi>That Will?</hi> And that it cannot be concluded from thoſe general Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, nor from the Doctrine of Providence, is plain enough from the inſtance before: and this ſhews, how unſuitable the Caſe is which
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107829:56"/> he brings for a Parallel, <hi>Do we uſe to ſay a man may give his Eſtate to whom he will, when his Eſtate is entay'ld, and he cannot alienate it from the Right Heir?</hi> I ſay no: We do not uſe to ſay ſo, becauſe it is none of <hi>his</hi> to give. But this we <hi>uſe to ſay,</hi> that if any man has an Eſtate of his own to give, he muſt <hi>evidently</hi> give it, before the Perſon to whom he gives it, can have a good Title to it: And if he that claims by ſuch Gift, has no other Evidence but Poſſeſſion, I doubt that will be no bar to the <hi>Heir at Law.</hi> And it would be a Ridiculous Plea for ſuch a Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, to ſay that he that own'd the Eſtate, might give it to <hi>whomſoever</hi> he would. And <hi>whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever</hi> did not <hi>ſignifie</hi> the Heir at Law; nor did <hi>giving to whomſoever he would,</hi> ſignifie giving it only to thoſe, to whom the Law gives it. And if the Dr will give me leave to uſe his own Expreſſions, <hi>Thus the Dr. expounds God's giving Kingdoms to whomſoever he will.</hi> And after a train of ſuch wretched fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies, the Dr. concludes with this Magiſterial Rant, <hi>He may if he pleaſe, call this expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture; but I doubt every body elſe will give it to ſome other name; and I hope he himſelf upon ſecond thoughts will be aſham'd of it.</hi> Now I do not know what the Dr. will be <hi>aſham'd of:</hi> but if Sophiſtical Arguments, eſpecially if they relate to the interpretation of Scripture, be matter of <hi>ſhame,</hi> I ſhall leave it with him, who has the moſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to be <hi>aſham'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is more abſurd ſtill, if we apply it to the occaſion,</hi> viz. <hi>thoſe great Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and Changes of Empires, which the</hi> Prophet <hi>foretold, and which he attributes to God:</hi> And where is this great abſurdity? Why ſaith he, <hi>when Kingdoms and Empires are overturned by violence, it is</hi> non-ſenſe <hi>to talk of God's ſetting up only Rightful Kings, not <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers.</hi> Yes, by all means; To ſay that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was a <hi>Rightful</hi> King, is <hi>non-ſenſe.</hi> And to ſay that the <hi>Romans</hi> were <hi>Rightful</hi> Governors, is <hi>non-ſenſe;</hi> and the Convocation ſpeak <hi>non-ſenſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Convoc. p. 82.</note> when they expreſly affirm it. To ſay that forceable and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Beginnings, may afterwards acquire a Right, is <hi>non-ſenſe.</hi> Theſe it ſeems are ſuch things which no body can underſtand, and they plainly contradict the Reaſon of Mankind. Now I grant, that <hi>non-ſenſe</hi> is an <hi>abſurdity;</hi> but I think 'tis <hi>abſurd</hi> likewiſe, to charge any Propoſition with <hi>non-ſenſe,</hi> and not be able to make it out. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Kingdoms are not transferred, nor Kings remov'd, nor ſet up by Law: And therefore when the</hi> Prophet <hi>tells us with reſpect to ſuch violent Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that God changes times and ſeaſons, that he removeth and ſetteth up Kings, an ingenious man muſt be hard put to it to ſay, this is not meant of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers, but of Rightful and Legal Kings.</hi> And why ſo I pray? Is it ſo very hard to conceive, how vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Revolutions, may end in a Legal Right, and become Juſt Governments? Or is there any neceſſity from the violence of the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, to conclude, that a Prince ſetled in the Throne upon ſuch a Revolution, could not have acquir'd ſuch a Right? This is plainly falſe in fact: The Revolution in <hi>Judaea</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> was as violent as any, and yet he had acquir'd a Right to the Government of it, by the Submiſſion of the Legal Prince, as well as by God's expreſs Will: And this is the firſt inſtance that theſe words of <hi>Daniel</hi> refer to; and the ſame is to be ſaid of all the reſt of the Governments within the Compaſs of that Prophetical Interpretation. And therefore the <hi>violence</hi> of the Revolution, is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Unrightfulneſs of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And tho the Prophet tells us, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſuch violent Revolutions, that God removes and ſets up Kings, it can never from thence be concluded, that by ſetting up Kings, is meant Uſurpers; becauſe in the very Caſe to which the words refer, thoſe Kings were not Uſurpers: And becauſe the nature of the thing does not imply it: for a Revolution may be violent, and yet the Government ſetled upon it, be Legal and Rightful, and not Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. And this I take to be the ſtate of the Caſe: Revolutions are not made by Laws, but thorough Settlements are: and it is not a Revolution, but a thorough Settlement, that diſtinguiſhes between an Uſurper, and a Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King; or if the Dr. pleaſe, between a King and no King. He that in a violent Revolution, as violently poſſeſſes himſelf of the Throne, and hath no more Right to it after, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is an Uſurper, and no King; but he that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:107829:57"/> afterwards acquires a Right, is a King, and no Uſurper. The Dr. differs as to the notion of a Settlement; but the inference, even with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his own notion, is the ſame: for he owns, that it is not a duty to obey a Perſon in Poſſeſſion of the Throne, 'till he is tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly ſetled (in his ſenſe). And that is, till then, he is no King; for he is a King of Clouts, whom no body is bound to obey; ſo that either way it is not <hi>God's ſetting up,</hi> or <hi>ſetting upon the Throne,</hi> that denominates a King, but that joyn'd with other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and the Queſtion between us is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is the Conſent of the States and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or the Acquiſition of Right.</p>
            <p>The Dr. ſays, <hi>If I will allow the diſpoſſeſſed Kings to be Legal Kings, he wonders how I ſhould fanſie, that thoſe Kings who diſpoſſeſs the Rightful Kings, and place themſelves in their Thrones, ſhould in my ſenſe be Legal and Rightful Kings too.</hi> And yet I had told him how, as plain as I could ſpeak, by the Death or Ceſſion of thoſe diſpoſſeſſed Kings. And the Dr. if he pleaſe, may wonder ſtill; but it had been as well, if he had anſwer'd it.</p>
            <p>I now come to his Teſtimony from the New Teſtament, Rom. 13.1, 2. <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the Higher Powers;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 52.</note> 
               <hi>for all power is of God,</hi> &amp;c. To this I ſaid, that <hi>by Powers, the Dr. underſtands <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped as well as Lawful Powers.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Poſtſcr. p. 12.</note> 
               <hi>And his Reaſon is, becauſe the Scripture makes no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between Kings and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers.</hi> And to theſe, the Dr. adds thoſe words he had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in his <hi>Caſe of Allegiance (between Kings whom we muſt, and whom we muſt not obey):</hi> And then tells me, <hi>theſe laſt words I conceal, becauſe they ſpoil all my Argument.</hi> And if they do ſo, I will confeſs it was ill done to conceal them: But if they do not, 'tis humorſome and captious to complain of it. And let us ſee his Reaſon; <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he adds, I thought the Caſe of</hi> Athaliah <hi>had been a Diſtinction, and had this precept been given in thoſe days, I wonder whether any body would have doubted of whom it ought to be underſtood, of</hi> Athaliah, <hi>or</hi> Joaſh. Very well, this was my Argument; but how comes this to be ſpoyl'd by thoſe laſt words? That I cannot tell; and it may be, the Dr. will tell me in his next. But at preſent he replys, <hi>There was a diſtinction between</hi> Athaliah <hi>and</hi> Joaſh, <hi>that ſhe was an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, and he a Rightful King:</hi> and the Dr. makes a <hi>Diſtinction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, and a Rightful King, with reſpect to their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation and their Right: But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this I ſay, the Scripture makes no diſtinction between a Rightful King and an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, with reſpect to the obedience of Subjects, while they are ſetled in the Throne.</hi> No! What does he think of ſetting up <hi>Joaſh</hi> when out of poſſeſſion; and depoſing <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> when in poſſeſſion? This I think is a diſtinction between a Rightful King and an Uſurper, <hi>with reſpect to the obedience of Subjects.</hi> And, with the Drs. leave, I am apt to believe, that Killing on the one hand, and Crowning and Allegiance on the other hand, is a conſiderable <hi>diſtinction</hi> in that reſpect. What follows that <hi>in reference to this, the Caſe of</hi> Athaliah <hi>is no Example of ſuch a diſtinction, becauſe the</hi> Jews <hi>might and did lawfully ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to her, and that ſhe was afterwards depos'd, was owing to the Divine Entail.</hi> This hath been urged, and anſwered before, and it is not at all to the Drs. purpoſe now. For the Queſtion here is <hi>only,</hi> whether there be ſuch a <hi>diſtinction</hi> in Scripture, with reſpect to the Subject's Obedience. And if the ſetting up <hi>Joaſh,</hi> and the depoſing and ſlaying <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> be not a <hi>Diſtinction,</hi> there is no ſuch thing as a <hi>Diſtinction</hi> in the World. The Dr. adds, <hi>Had this Law been given to the</hi> Jews <hi>at that time, while</hi> Joaſh <hi>was conceal'd, it muſt have been expounded of</hi> Athaliah, <hi>who had poſſeſſion of the Throne, when</hi> Joaſh <hi>was known and anointed, it muſt have been expounded of him, as having a Divine Right to the Throne of</hi> Judah. That is to ſay, this Law would have been expounded of the Uſurper, if there be no Right Heir, or none known; but when the Right Heir is known, it is to be interpreted of him, and not of the Uſurper. As if any body could think this Law would have been expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> if he had not been living, or had not been thought to have been living. But what I pray has this <hi>Concealment</hi> to do in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? The <hi>Diſtinction</hi> is not between the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment</hi> of the one, and the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of the other, but between <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation,</hi> and both viſible: between <hi>Joaſh</hi> out of Poſſeſſion,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:107829:57"/> and <hi>Athaliah</hi> in Poſſeſſion of the Throne. And here is the Queſtion, <hi>of whom ought this Precept to be underſtood, of</hi> Athaliah <hi>or</hi> Joaſh? if of <hi>Athaliah,</hi> then ſhe was ordain'd of God, and to reſiſt her, had been to receive Damnation, which was plainly falſe; for ſhe was reſiſted and killed, and both juſtify'd: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if it was to be underſtood of <hi>her,</hi> then it could not be underſtood of <hi>Joaſh;</hi> for it cannot be interpreted of Two Competitors. But if it muſt be underſtood of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> then a Rightful Prince out of Poſſeſſion, is the <hi>Higher Powers</hi> in the ſenſe of this Text, and an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in Poſſeſſion, is not. And then the whole Reaſon of the Drs. Argument fails, then the <hi>Powers that be,</hi> may be the <hi>Rightful Powers</hi> out of Poſſeſſion, in the intention, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the direction of that Text. And then there is a <hi>Diſtinction in Scripture between Kings whom we muſt obey,</hi> and Uſurpers (the Dr. calls them <hi>Kings) whom we muſt not obey;</hi> which is the thing to be proved.</p>
            <p>I proceeded, <hi>But (ſaith the Dr.) if the Apoſtle had intended ſuch a Diſtinction, he ought to have ſaid it in expreſs words, and why ſo I pray?</hi> The Dr. replys, <hi>I gave him a reaſon for it, which he is pleaſed to conceal, why ſhould we think the Apoſtle here intends a diſtinction unknown in Scripture?</hi> But ſure I did not conceal this, for I had ſpoken to it juſt before, as much as I thought needful; and I did not ſee any reaſon to repeat it again. The Dr. adds, he ſaid, <hi>had there been any ſuch Rule before given to ſubmit to lawful Powers, but not to ſubmit to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers, there had been ſome pretence of underſtanding St.</hi> Paul's <hi>all power, of all Legal Power; but there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing like this any where elſe in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? If he had intended any ſuch diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he ought to have ſaid it in expreſs words, or elſe no body could reaſonably have underſtood him to intend this Precept of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the higher powers, only of Powers that had a Legal Right.</hi> Now I cannot tell why the Dr. ſhould ſay I conceal'd this, for I anſwer'd it, and that I think is not concealing it. I had ſaid <hi>are there not general</hi> Rules <hi>about right and wrong, which extend to all Caſes and Perſons?</hi> And if they extend to <hi>all Caſes and Perſons,</hi> then there are Rules in Scripture about the Right and Wrong of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and about Legal and Uſurped Powers, and ſo I meant it, and could mean nothing: and ſo that if the Dr. had any Reaſon to diſprove this he had no Reaſon to ſay,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 53.</note> 
               <hi>This I thought a very good Reaſon, and did not expect to have been asked for more, till they had been anſwer'd:</hi> for that is a very good anſwer to it, as we ſhall ſee preſently.</p>
            <p>He goes on, <hi>But (ſaith our Author) does not the nature of the thing ſufficiently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it?</hi> He replyes, <hi>the nature of the thing diſtinguiſhes between a Legal King, and an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper; but the nature of the thing does not prove, that uſurped powers are not the higher powers, and ought not to be obey'd, but I think proves the quite contrary:</hi> that is to ſay, the nature of the thing diſtinguiſhes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween who has, and who has not a Right to the Government. And that I think is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to diſtinguiſh between who are, and who are not <hi>the Higher Powers.</hi> And it had been ſuperfluous to diſtinguiſh in expreſs terms, what is imply'd in the very Precept; as the Precept to obey Parents, Husbands, Maſters, do not expreſly diſtinguiſh between thoſe which are, and thoſe which are not ſo; for 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways imply'd, and an expreſs diſtinction is needleſs. And there is no Rule in Scripture given, to ſubmit to lawful, and not unlawful Husbands, and Maſters, any more than there is to ſubmit to lawful and not unlawful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors. But I think for all that, no body que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of whom the Precept is intended; or that thoſe that are the lawful, are thoſe only that are meant, altho there be no expreſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction excluding the unlawful from any ſhare or partnerſhip in it. But the truth is, that is always imply'd, and ſuch caſes are under the direction of general Rules: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaid, <hi>Are there not general Rules about Right and Wrong,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Poſtſcript, p 12.</note> 
               <hi>which extend to all Perſons and Caſes?</hi> By which I meant, that the Rights and Wrongs that reſpect Government, are under the direction of thoſe Rules, as much as the Rights and Wrongs that concern Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Property. He that unjuſtly poſſeſſes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man's Throne, is as much an unjuſt Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor, as much bound to Reſtitution; and men are as much bound not to partake with
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107829:58"/> him, and become party's to his injuſtice, nor to ſupport and abet it againſt Right, by virtue of theſe general Rules, as they are the ſame in private Caſes He that abets an unjuſt Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of the Throne, is as much <hi>Particeps cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis</hi> as he that abets an unjuſt Poſſeſſor of any other mans eſtate. And now let us hear his reply, <hi>Yes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there are</hi> (ſuch gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules) <hi>ſuch is the Apoſtle's Rule in this Chapter,</hi> to give to every one their due: <hi>But then the Queſtion returns what is their due?</hi> Before I conſider his Anſwer, I ſhall crave leave to give him this Anſwer to his Queſtion, Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Throne is their <hi>due.</hi> And this I think can never be deny'd by a man that owns the diſpoſſeſſed Prince hath ſtill a <hi>Legal Right, by virtue of which he may recover his Throne if he can;</hi> and if he hath a Right to it, then it is <hi>due</hi> to him: And I would fain know how engaging, and endeavouring all we can, and ſwearing to keep him from his Right, be a compliance with this Precept <hi>to give to every man his due.</hi> The Dr. hath a ſubtle Diſtinction between a Right to the Government, and a Right to Allegiance, which I ſhall conſider pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, but if it was granted him, it will not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the force of this Argument; for ſuppoſe the Poſſeſſor of the Throne had a Right to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, and the diſpoſſeſſed Prince a Right to the Government; how comes Allegiance to warrant an Act of injuſtice, to pray and fight, and do all we can, againſt a manifeſt Right, and which we know to be ſo. If he ought to have the Government,<note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg. p.</note> as the Dr. expreſſes it, <hi>he ought to be King but is not,</hi> then 'tis injuſtice to keep him from it; for no man <hi>ought</hi> to have what can <hi>juſtly</hi> be kept from him. And then I would fain know by what Rules of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Allegiance (if it were due) can juſtifie our acting againſt a moral Law. For if obedience be not his Right, the Crown is, and obedience to the moſt Rightful Prince in the World will not excuſe our aiding and aſſiſting him, in the unrighteous taking or keeping another man's Eſtate, if it be notorious and manifeſt.</p>
            <p>We come now to the Drs. Anſwer to this Queſtion, <hi>What is their due? whether Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and Obedience be not due to the Prince, who governs, not to the Prince who does not, and cannot govern, whatever his Legal Right to the Government be?</hi> And to this he ſays, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the controverſie turns on it he ſhall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly conſider it.</hi> The Arguments he ſays is this, <hi>He who by the Laws of the Land has a Right to the Crown, has a Right to our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance; and whether he be in or out of Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion to own any other King, and to ſubmit and pay Allegiance to any other, though actually poſſeſſed of, and ſetled in the Throne, is a great injuſtice to our natural Prince, and a violation of that precept to give to every one their due.</hi> To this the Dr. Anſwers, <hi>Here are two things to be conſidered,</hi> 1. <hi>The Right to the Crown.</hi> 2. <hi>The Right to Allegiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the firſt the ſubſtance of his Anſwer is, <hi>The fundamental prejudice and miſtake, ſeems to be, the making no difference between a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Right to the Crown, and a Legal Right of Subjects to their Eſtates;</hi> but the Dr. <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends a great difference, that in ſetling an Eſtate, nothing more is required but a meer Humane Right, but to make a Legal King, beſides an Humane Right to the Crown he muſt have God's Authority: Nothing but a Legal Deſcent and Poſſeſſion gives Right to a Legal Eſtate; and therefore the Law muſt have its effect: And is the only adequate Rule of right and wrong in ſuch Caſes; and tho the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God allots mens private fortunes, yet he gives no man a right to an Eſtate which he gets by fraud, nor exempts them from Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal puniſhments, but leaves all ſuch meer Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Rights, under the general influence of Providence, to the care of Publick Government. But if a meer Humane Right cannot make a King, but God's Authority makes a King; if God reſerves this Authority in his own hands, and does not inſeparably annex it to Humane Entails of the Crown, if God's Authority with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Humane Right can make a King, but Humane Laws cannot make a King without God's Authority; this may ſatisfie us, that when God thinks fit to interpoſe his Authority, a meer Legal Right is not ſufficient Reaſon to adhere to a Prince God has removed from the Throne; nor the want of a Legal Right, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon to diſown a Prince, whom God has ſet upon the Throne.</hi> Now here is ſome variety of expreſſion, but very little new matter but what the Dr. had ſaid, and what is anſwered before; but he hath a peculiar delight in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107829:58"/> his Anſwers over and over; but I hope I may be excuſed if I do not follow him in that. And therefore as to the difference in the Events of providence, with reſpect to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and private Eſtates; and as to God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving his Authority in his own hands, and his interpoſing by providence: I ſhall refer the Reader to the Anſwers I gave before to them; at preſent this Anſwer is ſufficient: That the Law, and not Providence, is the adequate Rule of right and wrong with reſpect to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, as well as with reſpect to the Poſſeſſors of private Eſtates, and the Law ought to have its effect in one caſe, as well as the other; and I would feign know how providence comes to be a <hi>Rule of right and wrong</hi> in any caſe, or what ſenſe the Dr. can make of ſuch a propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? 'tis mere trifling and fallacious to ſay, that <hi>to make a Legal King, beſides a Humane Right to the Crown, he muſt have God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> And what then? therefore he that has Poſſeſſion and no Legal Right has God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? This is a wild conſequence; He that is Maſter of the <hi>Temple</hi> hath a Legal Right to it, but beſides that Right he muſt have God's Authority to preach and adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and therefore whoſoever by Intruſion and Uſurpation Preaches and Adminiſters the Sacraments there, is Maſter of the <hi>Temple.</hi> The Dr. knows well enough, that we have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with him about God's Authority; but about the Communication of it, whether this Authority be communicated by the <hi>Events</hi> of providence (the methods and intentions of which are unſearchable) or by fixed and ſtated Rules, allowed and commanded by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be obſerved; or whether the Subject in whom this Authority reſides, be him that has a Legal Right to the Government, or him that has no Right; ſo that it is not at all to his purpoſe to prove, that a Legal King muſt have God's Authority, or that God's Authority makes Kings; for no body doubts of that, but the Queſtion is, whether the Authority of God be annexed to the Legal Right, or to the Events of providence. He ſays, <hi>God does not inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably annex his Authority to Humane Entails.</hi> Right, but then he does annex it, tho not inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably, and no body can ſeparate it but himſelf, and the Queſtion is, whether a meer eventual Poſſeſſion be ſuch a ſeparation; God does not inſeparably annex property to Legal Right, but may diſpoſe of it by his own Sovereign Will and Council; He gave the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> goods to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as well as <hi>Joram</hi>'s Crown to <hi>Jehu.</hi> And therefore the <hi>fundamental miſtake</hi> the Dr. ſpeaks of, of <hi>making no difference between a Legal Right to the Crown, and a Legal Right of Subjects to their Eſtates</hi> is no miſtake at all; for there is no difference with reſpect to God's Sovereign Will, no difference with reſpect to providence, which is the main Queſtion. Well, <hi>but for ſetling an Eſtate, nothing more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired but a meer Humane Right: But to make a Legal King, beſides an Humane Right to the Crown, he muſt have God's Authority; by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling an Eſtate,</hi> the Dr. means a <hi>Right</hi> to it; otherwiſe it is not to the purpoſe, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a difference between <hi>Legal Right</hi> to the Crown, and a <hi>Legal Right</hi> to private Eſtates; as he ſays afterwards, <hi>nothing but a Legal deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and a Legal Poſſeſſion gives Right to a Legal Eſtate.</hi> And this is his own miſtake, for God is Proprietor of all the World; and all the World is his as well as Authority, and no man can have a Right to any part of it, but as that Right is derived to him from God, <hi>meer Humane Right,</hi> or meer Humane Law, gives no more Right to a private Eſtate, then it does to Authority; for all is Gods, and it is not the peculiar Caſe of Authority, but every thing elſe paſſes by delegation and commiſſion from him; no man hath a Right to his Eſtate or Goods, and no man hath a Right to Authority but what God gives. But the only Queſtion is, how theſe Rights are conveyed; and that is by the reſpective Laws of each Country, he that hath a Right by Law, hath a Right from God, and he that hath not a Right by Law hath no Right from God: The Laws as authorized and appointed by him, are the Channels whereby this Right is conveyed; and he that poſſeſſes himſelf any other way, makes a property to himſelf, but he hath no Right to it, and God does not give it him: This therefore is not (as the Dr. talks) confining God, but obſerving the Rules and Methods he himſelf hath war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted and directed. There are indeed ſome Caſes, wherein the Law makes a Property, and God does not; but this is quite contrary to the Drs. Hypotheſis and confutes it: And that is, when by fraud and injuſtice and corrupt means,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107829:59"/> men gain Eſtates; they may have a Title in Law to their unjuſt acquiſitions, but they hold them by Uſurpation, and have no Right to them with reſpect to God, and are bound to reſtore them, which is a Demonſtration they have no Right to them, nor hath God given them, tho he permits them by his providence to poſſeſs themſelves of them. And this plain and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Doctrine, ſits hard upon more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples than one of the Drs. And from thence it plainly followe, he that attains any thing by unju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t and wicked arts, hath no Right to it in reſpect of God, whatſoever he may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have in reſpect of Men; and if he that unjuſtly gains a ſhilling is ſo far an Uſurper, and hath for that reaſon no Right to it from God, then he that by as bad or worſe arts U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurps a Throne, has likewiſe no Right to it in reſpect of God: And this directly contradicts the fundamental Doctrine of the Drs. Books.</p>
            <p>But perhaps the Dr. may like this better in his own words, and he may find them in his <hi>Diſcourſe of Religious Aſſemb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies</hi> (p. 85.) <hi>There is a vaſt difference between God's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the proſperity of bad men, and that conſtant providence which watches over good men; bad men may advance themſelves by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, oppreſſion, and perjury, but they are not advanced by the bleſſing, but by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of God, for God never bleſſes any wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed arts; and therefore ſuch mens proſperity is very uncertain, and as tottering as the <hi>Thrones of Vſurpers;</hi> for tho they have a good Title with reſpect to men, yet they are but <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers, with reſpect to God, and therefore are tumbled down at his pleaſure.</hi> Now this I take to be very good Doctrine, and the Dr. hath not formally renounc'd it, but he hath inverted the Argument, and ſet it with the <hi>heels</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and <hi>Now</hi> thoſe that by the moſt wicked and unjuſt arts are Uſurpers with reſpect to men, have a Divine Right and a good Title with reſpect to God, which is ſuch a way of God's giving Right, and men receiving a Right from him, that no Caſuiſt in the World ever dreamed of before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As for the Right to Allegiance,</hi> The Dr. tells us, <hi>it was the great deſign of his book to prove, that Allegiance was not immediatly due to a Legal Right to the Crown, but to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that therefore he denies a Prince who has the Legal Right, no Right which he can juſtly claim, who denies Alleg. to him, when he is out of the Throne. And</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>methinks our Author ſhould have anſwered all that I ſaid upon this Argument, before he had ſo d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gmatically told us, that the</hi> general Rules about right and wrong, which extend to all Perſons and Caſes, <hi>made it needleſs, for St</hi> Paul <hi>to have told us, that by the higher Powers, and the Powers that are, he meant only Legal Powers.</hi> Now I thought I had anſwered his Argument from providence, and which alſo 'till now the Dr. tells me otherwiſe, I took to be the <hi>great deſign</hi> of his book; and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>that Government and Allegiance are Relatives</hi> was not quite neglected, and the Dr. ſound it ſo; and what is it that I have not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered upon this argument? why as he now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats it, <hi>That Allegiance is not due to Legal Right but to Government,</hi> &amp;c. Now I have proved over and over, that Allegiance is due on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Legal Prince; that it is not due to an Uſurper, who actually adminiſters the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but to the Legal Prince when he does not actually adminiſter it. And that I think is anſwering it; but ſome men complain for want of anſwers, when they have more already then they can tell what to do with. But the Dr. is ſure <hi>the Reaſon of things does not prove the contrary: For when the Allegiance and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Subjects, is a duty only for the ſake of Government, for the eaſe and ſafety of it, it is very ſtrange, that it ſhould not be due to a ſetled Government, but due to a Prince, who does not, and cannot govern;</hi> cannot govern? who hinders him? why, as the Dr. puts the Caſe, the Uſurper and his Confederates; and that is an argument that they owe him no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance; juſt as <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his accomplices firſt diſabled the King, and then cryed they ow'd him no Allegiance, becauſe he could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them. <hi>But Allegiance is for the ſake of Government, and therefore whoever actually governs (let him be who he will) hath a Right to Allegiance;</hi> but firſt, arguments drawn from the <hi>ſake</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of things to prove the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of Rights and Duties are abſurd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequent; Marriage is for the <hi>ſake</hi> of Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Society; and if a Husband is impriſoned or under force, ſo as he cannot keep his Wife company; it is <hi>very ſtrange,</hi> that ſhe ſhould
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107829:59"/> not be a Wife to him that does keep her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and not to him, who neither does nor can; and juſt ſuch another argument, is the Drs. from the <hi>ſake</hi> of Government: But the Truth is Allegiance, is not due to <hi>Government,</hi> nor is it for the ſake of Government, but it is due and owing to the Perſon of the Prince, by the Laws of God and Man; and therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows his Perſon, whether in or out of Poſſeſſion. But let us put the Argument into the terms of the Queſtion, and inſtead of <hi>Government</hi> put <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation,</hi> and then ſee what the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of things prove, and then I think it is plain enough, that <hi>the Allegiance and Obedience of Subjects, is not a duty</hi> only or at all <hi>for the ſake of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,</hi> nor were they ever intended <hi>for the eaſe and ſafety</hi> of Uſurpation, but the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, what is a duty for <hi>the ſake and ſafety</hi> of the Legal Government, is for the prevention and deſtruction of Uſurpation: And it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what extraordinary to ſay that was for the <hi>ſake</hi> of Uſurpation, which was deſigned to prevent it.</p>
            <p>The Dr. proceeds, <hi>if I may have liberty to diſpute with this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor upon his own Principles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 56.</note> 
               <hi>I deſire to know of him, whether Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance be due to any Prince upon any other account, than his being inveſted with God's Authority? Let him ſay it at the utmoſt peril of his Cauſe.</hi> Now I confeſs I am not very fond of giving up my Cauſe <hi>gratis,</hi> except the Dr. could give me ſome better reaſons for it; yet becauſe the Dr. threatens, and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates,<note place="margin">P. 65.</note> that I am no very <hi>cool</hi> man, and ſo may be apt to be provoked; this I will ſay, and let him make his beſt of it; That Allegiance is due to the Prince upon the account or by the obligation of Humane Law: Now this is either <hi>another account</hi> or the very ſame; if <hi>another account,</hi> then the Drs huffing Queſtion means nothing, and there is no peril in ſaying ſo, if the very ſame, then Humane Law in this Caſe is God's Authority, and God's Authority is derived by Humane Law, and then his Arguments mean nothing. And this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers his following Queſtions, <hi>How then does God inveſt any Prince with his Authority of Government, whom he does not immediatly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate as in the Kingdom of</hi> Judah? why tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt as he inveſts a man with a property to any of his Goods or Eſtate, even by Law and Common Right. But ſaith he, <hi>it muſt be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by annexing his Authority to the Legal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or by placing ſuch a Perſon on the Throne by what means ſoever he does it, or by both.</hi> I do not know what the Dr. means by <hi>Both;</hi> the controverſie is, when there is a competition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Legal Right</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation,</hi> and then the Queſtion is, which of theſe are inveſted with God's Authority? And then I ſay, that God annexes his Authority to the Perſon, who hath a Right to the Government, and not to the Uſurper who hath no Right. And this is an anſwer according to my Principles which the Dr. pretends to diſpute upon. But if the Dr. had rather have it in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s own expreſſions, then I ſay, that God does annex his Authority to the <hi>Legal Office.</hi> And he, whoſe the Legal Office is, has God's Authority, whether he be or be not actually poſſeſſed of that Office; the Office is his who hath a Right to it, and the Authority is his from God, and no body elſe hath either the Authority or the Office, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudes upon both, and invades God's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as much as he does another mans Office. But ſaith he, <hi>then it is certain, no Prince can have God's Authority, who is not in Poſſeſſion of the Throne, and then no Allegiance can be due to him.</hi> Now this conſequence lies a great way of, and at firſt ſight a man would be apt to admire how it ſhould follow from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, for tho it might do pretty well from one of the branches, from <hi>placing a Perſon on the Throne by what means ſoever;</hi> yet how comes it to follow from the other, from <hi>God's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing his Authority to the Legal Office.</hi> The Propoſitions are complex and made up of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts, and the concluſion is drawn from one of them; for how does it follow, becauſe God hath annexed his Authority to the Legal Office; therefore no Prince hath his Authority who is not in Poſſeſſion of the Throne? is there any more an inſeparable connexion between the Legal Office of a King, and Poſſeſſion of the Throne, than there is between a Legal Eſtate, and an Illegal Poſſeſſion of it? A Legal Eſtate is the right owners, whether he be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of it or no, and a Legal Office is his who hath a Right to it, and all the Authorities, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, and Preeminencies that are annexed to it are his, whether he actually has the office in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107829:60"/> or not. Property is annexed to Right and not to Poſſeſſion; and whoſoever hath a Right to any thing that thing is his, and no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies elſe, and whoſoever hath a Right to an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the Office is his, and the exerciſe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of it, does not alter the Property; Well, but the Dr proves it, <hi>If,</hi> ſays he, <hi>God's Authority be annexed to the Regal Office, a Prince muſt be in the actual adminiſtration of the Regal Office and Power, before he can have God's Authority.</hi> Now this is nothing but the old ſtory of <hi>Actual Adminiſtration</hi> over again, only it was before applied to <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and here it is apply'd to the <hi>Regal Office.</hi> But the Argument and Anſwer is the ſame; the Regal Office is his who hath a Right to it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be poſſeſſed of it or no; <hi>And if God's Authority be annexed to the Regal Office,</hi> it is annexed to his Perſon whoſe the Office of Right is, and not to his, whoſe it is not; every thing is the right owner's, whether it be in his own Poſſeſſion, or injuriouſly kept from him. Another man may uſurp it, but if he does it is none of his own, he may have the Poſſeſſion, but the Property is in the right owner The <hi>Regal Office</hi> is the Kings Property, and he hath all the Authority annexed to it, whether he can, or cannot actually adminiſter it; but the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per has neither the Office nor the Authority, and all that he has is an unjuſt adminiſtration, and a wrongful Poſſeſſion of that which is none of his own; and I would fain know which way he ſhould have the Authority, when the Office to which the Authority is annexed is none of his.

This I ſuppoſe the Dr. will not ſay, but then it follows, that <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity without Actual Adminiſtration is not Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in fancy and</hi> Idea; <hi>and that God does give his Authority to govern without the Power of Government</hi> (in the Drs. ſenſe) And the diveſting of Power and actual adminiſtration is not diveſting a Prince of God's Authority, which remains with his Perſon, and the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter is indelible.

He was the <hi>Lords Anointed</hi> ſtill, and ſo remained to the laſt minute of his life; the <hi>Regicides</hi> had the Power of Government, and he had not, but that did not transfer God's Authority from him to them; but he was the ſame King, and had the ſame Authority from God upon the Scaffold as he had upon the Throne; from whence 'tis plain enough that Authority is not annexed to actual Power or actual Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; wicked People may take away the Power of Government, but they cannot take away the Authority. And this is the very ſame in all the inſtances of Authority in the World, the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Powers of Father, Husband, Maſter, may be ſuſpended by the ungovernableneſs of thoſe under their Power, or by other accidents, or they may be exerciſed by other Perſons: But the reſpective <hi>Authorities</hi> all this while are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Rightful Perſons, and not to the Exerciſe or Adminiſtration: No man hath any more Authority than he hath Right, and he that exerciſes an Authority without Right, makes an Authority to himſelf, but he hath not God's Authority. In all ſuch Caſes indeed, there is not Power to force and compel, which the Dr. calls a <hi>fruitleſs and inſignificant Authority;</hi> but for all that it is not Authority <hi>in fancy and</hi> Idea, but real and valid; the Authority of a Parent (and Paternal Authority is as much God's Authority as the Regal) does not ceaſe to be the ſame Authority, nor to bind to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, when he has not <hi>Power</hi> to reſtrain the undutifulneſs and rebellion of his Children; and if it were our own Caſe, we ſhould ſoon diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh that we had Authority, tho we had not Power, and they were bound in Conſcience to obey us, tho we were not able to make them. And here is the ſtate of the Caſe, Authority binds the Conſcience, and Power can force the outward man: And that it ſeems i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Dr. proceeds to conſider the Parallel caſe I had inſtanced in (13.<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 57.</note> Heb. 17.) <hi>The Apoſtle exhorts to obey them, that have Rule over you meaning the Miniſters of the Goſpel: Now the Apoſtle makes no diſtinction between lawful Miniſters and Intruders, and yet we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of</hi> lawful Miniſters.</p>
            <p>He anſwers, <hi>But theſe Caſes are by no means Parallel; For the Author to the</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews <hi>had no Reaſon to make any ſuch diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which yet was neceſſary for St.</hi> Paul <hi>to have done, had he intended his Precept ſhould be underſtood only of lawful Powers;</hi> his proof is, <hi>The Apoſtle to the</hi> Hebrews <hi>knew who had the Rule over them at that time, that they were lawful Miniſters, and he exhorts the</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews <hi>to obey them, and had he added ſuch a diſtinction, it would have inſinuated, that he knew ſome among them who were not lawful Miniſters, and ſuch a ſuggeſtion without nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Perſons, would have made them jealous of them all, and ſpoiled his Exhortation of obeying them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, 1. The Drs. Reaſon is abſurd. 2. The ground of it is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</p>

               <note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg. p. 192.</note> 
               <hi>and carrying men into the dark Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths of Law and Hiſtory,</hi> (which is one of the Drs. weighty Reaſons for ſubmiſſion to actual Government and Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:) And was it ſo hard a matter for them in thoſe days to know who were, and who were not their lawful Miniſters, who were, and who were not ſent, and conſtituted by the Apoſtles? and methinks it is a pretty odd reaſon, if the Apoſtle had named <hi>lawful Rulers,</hi> it ſhould make them ſuſpicious of their <hi>lawful</hi> Rulers; it might have put them upon inquiry where there was doubt, and there is no harm, but a great deal of reaſon in that, but it would have ſecured and confirmed their obedience where there was no doubt: The Dr. tells us, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews <hi>knew whom St.</hi> Paul <hi>meant by theſe who had the Rule over them, and St.</hi> Paul <hi>knew they were ſuch as ought to be obeyed.</hi> Well! did the <hi>Hebrews</hi> know St. <hi>Paul</hi> meant them as <hi>lawful</hi> or as <hi>actual</hi> Miniſters, if as <hi>lawful</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters the Drs. reaſon of <hi>jealouſie</hi> is a trifle, for then it had been the ſame thing, whether he had or had not expreſly named it, for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and that is all one with naming it, and then the adding ſuch a diſtinction in expreſs terms imports no ſuch inſinuation as the Dr. ſuggeſts (which I think is plainly the Caſe): If only as <hi>actual</hi> Miniſters, then I doubt by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this precept, they were to ſubmit to a Miniſter <hi>de facto,</hi> tho not <hi>de jure,</hi> for if there was danger in naming <hi>lawful</hi> Miniſters, leſt they ſhould be <hi>jealous</hi> of their <hi>actual</hi> Miniſters, that Reaſon extends to all <hi>actual</hi> Miniſters; and ſo there is a fair gap opened for Uſurpers, Hereticks, and Apoſtates and they, if they could perſwade the People to own them, might claim the benefit, and be within the intention of this Precept; for it ſeems <hi>lawful</hi> was not to be named, leſt it ſhould make them <hi>jealous,</hi> which had indeed been a ſure way to prevent their jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, but not their being ſeduced, which ſeems to be the main end of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. But this is more abſurd ſtill, if this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept be conſidered as a ſtanding and perpetual Rule for all Ages of the Church: Do all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple know whom the Apoſtle meant, as well as the <hi>Hebrews?</hi> and did St. <hi>Paul</hi> know that all that bear ſpiritual Rule ought to be obeyed? Muſt not lawful be named leſt it ſhould be inſinuated, ſome are not <hi>lawful Miniſters</hi> or leſt any Body ſhould be <hi>jealous</hi> of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors? This is inconſiſtent with the Apoſtles own Cautions, to beware of <hi>Dogs</hi> and to avoid Hereticks, and with all experience. And I ſuppoſe the Dr. will not deny but that it had been better for them, and for Religion, if ſome People had been jealous of their Paſtors: And the truth is (as the World goes) a little jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie does well, and there is no great Reaſon to take every man for a Miniſter within this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, who calls himſelf ſo, and <hi>actually</hi> Rules; and this Precept is no Caution againſt jealouſie; and in other places St. <hi>Paul</hi> directly adviſes it. So that if the Dr. was any Reaſon with reſpect
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:107829:61"/> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> it is none with reſpect to the reſt of the World, except the Dr. can think there never was, nor never can be any actual Miniſters but who were lawful ones and ought to be obeyed: And the Dr. himſelf tells us, to juſtifie his expoſition of the 13 to the <hi>Romans</hi> in the next Page upon the account of actual Government, <hi>with reſpect to the reſt of the World, he ought to have made this diſtinction in expreſs words if he intended any diſtinction ſhould have been made;</hi> and I conceive the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> is of as general direction as the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Ground of the Drs. Reaſon is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; and that is that there were no falſe Teachers among the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> that there were Seducers and Hereticks before the time of the writing this Epiſtle (which is generally conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be the laſt but one of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles) is evident from all the Reſt of the Epiſtles, and that <hi>Judaea</hi> among all the Plantations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, ſhould be the only Climate without them, is not very accountable. The Apoſtle in this Chapter cautions againſt ſeducement. (Heb. 13.9.) <hi>Be not carry'd about with divers and ſtrange Doctrines.</hi> And theſe I ſuppoſe were not the Doctrines of their Lawful Miniſters, whoſe <hi>Faith</hi> he adviſes them to follow (v. 7.) as well as to ſubmit to them (v. 17.) And to apply this to the Drs. reaſon, I wonder why the diſtinction of <hi>ſtrange Doctrines,</hi> ſhould not make the <hi>Hebrews jealous</hi> of <hi>all</hi> the Doctrines their Miniſters taught them, as well as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of lawful Miniſters ſhould make them <hi>jealous</hi> of all their Miniſters. Reaſons ſure are very ſcarce when ſuch things as theſe are given for Reaſons; but ſomething muſt be ſaid, and it is great pity the Dr. ſhould be preſſed with an Argument and have nothing to ſay to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> (ſays he) <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>gives a general charge to be Subject to the higher Powers and generally affirms, that all Power is of God; and therefore, if he had not intended that we ſhould underſtand this, as univerſally as he expreſſes it,</hi> of all powers <hi>however they came by their Power, he ſhould have limited it to Legal and Rightful Powers:</hi> Very well! and I pray is not the charge to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> as <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> as that to the <hi>Romans?</hi> it is not ſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed obey <hi>all</hi> them that have rule over you; but it is expreſſed indefinitely (which is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollent to an univerſal) and in conſtruction it is to be underſtood univerſally, and means the ſame, as if it had been expreſly ſaid <hi>All</hi> them that Rule. And if it did not the Drs. Reaſon would be yet more pleaſant, for if by <hi>them that have Rule over you,</hi> may be meant <hi>ſome</hi> and not <hi>all</hi> of them that have Rule, then the Apoſtle did more than <hi>inſinuate that he knew</hi> ſome <hi>among them that were not lawful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and without naming the Perſons, ſuch a ſuggeſtion would have made them jealous of them all, and ſpoiled his exhortation of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them;</hi> So that if for nothing elſe, for the ſake of his own Reaſon, he muſt be forced to admit, that it is to be underſtood in an univerſal ſenſe. There is but one thing more, and that is St. <hi>Paul generally affirms that all Power is of God,</hi> and is not all Spiritual Power <hi>of God</hi> as well as Secular? That the Dr. will not deny: Now we muſt remember the Dr. tells us, <hi>theſe caſes are by no means Parallel:</hi> And yet when he comes to ſtate the Caſe of the 13 to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> he has not made the leaſt title of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. All Secular, and all Spiritual Power is of God, the charge in both is general, and the Precepts require to obey <hi>all</hi> them that Rule in one Caſe as well as the other; and if theſe Caſes be not <hi>Parallel</hi> with reſpect to the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, no man living knows what a <hi>Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel</hi> is. For what are the Drs. Reaſons for <hi>his</hi> Caſe? why the <hi>General charge,</hi> the <hi>univerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of expreſſion, the want of <hi>expreſs limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and here they are all, and in a Caſe of obedience to Rulers alſo. And as an addition to the Parallel, we may caſt in the Drs. Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Argument from Providence, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually fits a <hi>Providential Paſtor,</hi> as a <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential King;</hi> and therefore there is the ſame Reaſon to underſtand both precepts with the ſame limitation, and by <hi>all Rulers</hi> and <hi>all Powers</hi> we are to underſtand all <hi>Lawful Rulers</hi> and all <hi>Lawful Powers,</hi> and as an <hi>

And it does not ſeem reaſonable that St <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ianity it ſelf. And I believe another and more convenient reaſon may be aſſign'd, the Chriſtian Converts either then actually were, or in a ſhort time would be in a ſtate of Perſecution from the Heathen Emperors, and this might tempt them to undue behaviour towards their lawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours: The Pleas of <hi>Liberty, Religion</hi> and the <hi>illegal</hi> and <hi>unauthoritative</hi> acts of Kings were as plauſible then, as they have been ſince, and I believe any man that impartially conſiders the ſcope and tendency of this precept, will find, that the end of it was to preſs the neceſſity of obedience, and to ſhew the wickedneſs and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Reſiſtance in any caſe, and not to anſwer an objection of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> which in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability was foreign, and not at all concerned the <hi>Roman Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had embraced Chriſtianity;<note place="margin">Caſe of Reſiſt. ch. 4.</note> and truly juſt ſo the Dr. himſelf interprets it, and never 'till now (to ſerve a good purpoſe) thought that it had any reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the <hi>Phariſees</hi> or their objections. And to this I add, that if the Apoſtle had intended to obviate this objection of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> it ſeems reaſonable, and as I ſaid, <hi>'Tis probable he would have enjoyn'd obedience to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in expreſs terms,</hi> and this would have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually anſwered the objection, and there would have been no avoiding it; but as 'tis now expreſſed 'tis matter of diſpute, and the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> might have been of the ſame mind with the Dr heretofore, and thought St. <hi>Paul</hi> only meant it of <hi>Legal P wers;</hi> and had that been the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> end there cannot eaſily be given a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he did not roundly expreſs it? There would have been no danger from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Dr. knows by experience, who puts the Queſtion of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Powers,</hi> and writes a Book upon it; and the objection would have been plainly anſwered, and the Subjects might without heſitancy reſt ſatisfied upon it: But if we may believe the Dr. the Caſe had not been the ſame, if he had expreſly named <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Powers,</hi> tho he had intended it, for <hi>that would have inſinuated, that he knew ſome who were not lawful Powers, and ſuch a ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion without naming them would have made The Pe ple jealous of their Gover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107829:62"/> name <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Powers,</hi> had he intended them, he hath given no Reaſon.</p>
            <p>But the Dr. adds, <hi>Tho there was a diſtinction between Legal and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Powers, there was no diſtinction made in point of obedience to them, but only by the</hi> Phariſees; <hi>and therefore with reſpect to the reſt of the World, he ought to have made this diſtinction in expreſs words, if he intended any diſtinction ſhould have been made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> I ſuppoſe the Dr. hath enough already, and to ſhorten the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, I will grant him, <hi>that if there was no diſtinction with reſpect to the reſt of the world, between Legal and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Powers in point of obedience to them,</hi> then it was reaſonable for St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to have expreſſed <hi>lawful powers,</hi> had he intended by this Precept to have enjoyn'd obedience only to them. But then it follows, if there was always <hi>ſuch</hi> a diſtinction, then there is the ſame reaſon that he ought to have expreſs'd <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Powers,</hi> had he intended to enjoin obedience to them. Now I had urg'd him over and over, to ſhew me any one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Author, who had aſſerted, that <hi>Tyrannus ſine Titulo,</hi> The Caſe of his Book, and the Caſe now before us, was any lawful or any true Government; and the ſame I had put to him with reſpect to the Text in hand: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, he names but two, Mr <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

God doth not govern mankind like Beaſts in a Deſert, where every thing is Prey and Poſſeſſion, but by the Rules of Society, which confine and determine Property, and fix the bounds of it: And it would be a wiſe Queſtion to ask, How does God make a man a Right Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of an Eſtate in <hi>England?</hi> He does it by his Providence, but it is according to Laws: How did God make Kings in <hi>Judah,</hi> after he had entayl'd the Crown? why he made them by his Providence, but it was according to that entail; and ſo in other Kingdoms God makes Kings, and private Proprietors by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but it is according to the ſtandards of Right and Juſtice, that are fix'd and ſetled among men, and authoriz'd and confirm'd by God himſelf, and by the expreſs declarations of his will: And whatſoever exceeds, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to theſe, is Invaſion and Wrong, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and Rapine, expreſly diſallow'd, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid by God himſelf. And to ſay God gives by his Providence, what he forbids by his Revealed Will, is an Impious Doctrine, and juſtifies my charge againſt the Drs. interpretation, that it makes Providence a Rule of Practice, againſt Right and Juſtice. And a man may as well ſay, that God gave to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, tho he forbid them upon pain of Death, to eat of it, becauſe all Events are by Providence; and they were permitted by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to take it.</p>
            <p>And this anſwers what follows: <hi>Suppoſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a Prince aſcends the Throne, by the moſt unjuſt force and ungodly arts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 59.</note> 
               <hi>who places ſuch a Prince on the Throne, if God don't? Our Author according to his Principles muſt anſwer, that by God's permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he uſurps the Throne, but is no King, much leſs a King of God's making; well, let him call him what he pleaſe, it ſeems a Prince may aſcend the Throne, and govern a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for many years, without God's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and then I deſire to know, whether God rules in ſuch a Kingdom, while an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper fills the Throne:</hi> I ſay yes, God does govern by his Providence, but not by communicating his Authority to the Uſurper. And what does the Dr. think of thoſe times of Uſurpation in this Kingdom between 48 and 60? Did God govern in the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> all thoſe 12 years or not? And therefore what he ſays, <hi>for indeed will any man ſay, that God governs ſuch a Kingdom, as is not govern'd by his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Miniſter?</hi> is perfect fallacy by his own Principles; for he himſelf ſays it: and I ask him, had the <hi>Rump</hi> or <hi>Cromwell</hi> God's <hi>Authority</hi> or not? If they had, then four or five Leaves of his Book, and his account of their not being ſettled, and all that he ſays on that Head, is meer trifle, and contradicts what he ſays here: For if they had God's Authority, they ought to be obey'd, and no pretences of Loyalty could excuſe it. But if not, then God may govern a Kingdom, when thoſe perſons, who actually govern <hi>for many years,</hi> have not his Authority; nor yet are his Miniſters (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than as the Devil and wicked men are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to execute the deſigns of his Providence, but not as deriving any Authority from him: or thereby claiming any Right by vertue of their Actual or Providential Government.) And thus his following Queſtion is anſwer'd, <hi>Does Providence and Government ſignifie only his permiſſion? that God looks on, and ſees men ſnatch at Crowns, and take them
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107829:63"/> and keep them, and exerciſe an Authority, which he who is univerſal Lord of the world never gave them?</hi> Now here is a large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and if the Drs. Argument ſignified any thing, it would prove, that all the Sinful Events that ever were, or ſhall be in the world, have God's Authority reſpectively annex'd to them: for if it does follow, that becauſe <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Government do not ſignifie permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> that becauſe <hi>God does not meerly look on the affairs of the world, therefore whatever Authorities and Powers men</hi> ſnatch, <hi>and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and keep, God who is the univerſal Lord of the World, gives them.</hi> Then it plainly follows, that whatever Powers men have, and whatever Poſſeſſions or Goods they <hi>ſnatch or keep,</hi> tho never ſo unjuſtly, they are all the Gifts of God, and there is a Right and Property in them deriv'd from the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Lord of the World. But to our Inſtance And then the <hi>Rump</hi> and <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and the <hi>High Court of Juſtice,</hi> exercis'd God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt was murder'd, and his Son rob'd of his Crown by God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: For <hi>Providence and Government</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the ſame in thoſe days as they do now. And I wonder what the <hi>peoples conſent ſignifies</hi> according to this Doctrine? <hi>Does Providence and Government ſignifie permiſſion,</hi> when the people do not conſent, but not when they do? <hi>Does God look on, and ſee men ſnatch at Crowns, and take them, and keep them, and exerciſe an Authority, which he never gave them,</hi> when there is no conſent in <hi>Parliament,</hi> but otherwiſe when there is? One of theſe, the Dr. muſt forſake, and I believe he had better ſtick to the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Regicides</hi> and <hi>Cromwell,</hi> for then his Principles will be conſiſtent, and all of a piece, whereas now they agree like fire and water, and perpetually claſh and contradict each other.</p>
            <p>Here the Dr. ſtarts an Objection, <hi>that to ſay that proſperous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers are placed in the Throne by God, and have his Authority, is to make God a party to their wickedneſs.</hi> And thus he anſwers, <hi>This is another Argument, not meerly againſt God's making Kings, but in general againſt God's Providence and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: for if God cannot direct and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule rule the wickedneſs of men to accompliſh his own wiſe Counſels and Purpoſes, without being the</hi> Author <hi>of thoſe ſins, whereby ſuch events are brought to paſs, there is an end of the Providence of God, or of his Holineſs or Juſtice.</hi> And then he takes abundance of pains to prove, that <hi>God can over-rule the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of Princes, and the faction and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Subjects; that if he can permit the wickedneſs of men, without being guilty of their ſins, To direct and over-rule their wickedneſs to wiſe purpoſes, can be no blemiſh to Providence:</hi> And who denys this? But what is all this to the purpoſe? Is there no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>over-ruling</hi> wickedneſs, and giving Authority to it? Is it the ſame thing to <hi>over-rule the Ambition of Princes, and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Subjects to wiſe ends,</hi> and to Crown them with the Higheſt Priviledges and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, to ſtamp a Divine Character on them, and to command all men to Obedience and Reverence. God can, and does over-rule the wickedneſs of men, to accompliſh the wiſe and juſt deſigns of his Providence; but is that any argument, that a wicked poſſeſſion, is a Divine Right, and a Patent from Heaven, when a man is ſpoyl'd of his Goods or Eſtate, by the moſt wicked and unjuſt means, God may over-rule that wickedneſs, to chaſtiſe and correct the Right Owner for his Sins, or to cure his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and Carnal Affections, or to improve his Patience and Vertues. But does this create a Right and Property in the Cheat or Robber? In the Preſent Caſe, God may over-rule the wickedneſs of Uſurpation, to chaſtiſe the Sins of a Prince or People, or to try the conſtancy and fidelity of men to their Principles, or for other wiſe ends; But is this a proof, that an Uſurper is <hi>Jure Divino?</hi> To <hi>over-rule</hi> wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and to transfer a Right to it, are two very different things. The Dr. inſtances in the Crucifixion of our <hi>Saviour, which was the moſt glorious deſign of God's Providence, and was accompliſh'd by very wicked means,</hi> and which were over-ruled by God, to ſerve that glorious end; but that did not give any <hi>Authority</hi> to <hi>Judas</hi> to betray him, nor yet convey any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right to the Thirty Pieces, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd as the Reward of his Treachery.</p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:107829:64"/>
            <p>And therefore the Dr. hath not put the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection right with reference to the diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us; and it ought to have been this, <hi>That to entitle a wicked <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation to God's Authority, and a Divine Right, is to make God a Party to their wickedneſs.</hi> And then I would fain ſee, how this comes to be <hi>an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt God's Providence in general?</hi> For what tho <hi>God can</hi> and does <hi>direct and over-rule the wickedneſs of men to accompliſh his own wiſe counſels and purpoſes, without being the Author of thoſe ſins whereby ſuch events are brought to paſs?</hi> How I pray does this deny any thing of God's <hi>directing</hi> and <hi>over-ruling</hi> wickedneſs? Is it all one to <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>over-rule</hi> wickedneſs to wiſe Counſels and purpoſes, and to <hi>give authority</hi> to it? To give authority to wickedneſs, is to own and authorize it, to put upon it his own <hi>image and ſuperſcription:</hi> And to aſcribe this to God, is to make him a <hi>party</hi> to it, if it be poſſible to know what that word means. And therefore what follows is quite beſide the purpoſe: The Dr. ſuppoſes <hi>no man will deny, but God may give the Kingdoms of the World to whom he pleaſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 60.</note> 
               <hi>and pull down one Prince, and ſet up another without injuſtice;</hi> and then tells us, <hi>the only diſpute can be about God's bringing ſuch events to paſs by the wickedneſs of men, and what hurt is there in this, if God can ſo over-rule the ambition of Princes, or the faction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of Subjects, as to do that in purſuit of their own luſts which God for wiſe and holy reaſons, thinks ſit to have done.</hi> Why truly I know no <hi>hurt</hi> in all this; only it is not at all to the purpoſe, till the Dr. will pleaſe to ſhew us, how <hi>over-ruling</hi> comes to ſignifie <hi>giving Authority.</hi> He ſuppoſes again, <hi>an Ambitious Prince, which God may permit to ravage, and depopulate, and ſubdue King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;</hi> and then asks, <hi>Which moſt becomes the Divine Wiſdom to ſuffer ſuch men, when they pleaſe to overturn Kingdoms, and to bring horrible deſolations on the World, only to gratifie their own luſts, or to give the Reins, and proſperous ſucceſs to them, when he ſees fit, to new model the World,</hi> &amp;c. and then adds, <hi>I am ſure, this much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Wiſdom and Juſtice of Providence, than a bare permiſſion of ſuch violence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any farther deſign, which does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the wiſe Governor of the World.</hi> Not to meddle with thoſe bold expreſſions, what does, or what does not <hi>become the wiſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the World,</hi> I am ſure, it <hi>becomes</hi> us to ſpeak a little more modeſtly. And ſuppoſe God hath ſome farther deſign, in permitting ſuch Violences and Deſolations, than barely permitting them, does it follow therefore, that he gives his <hi>Authority</hi> to thoſe Violences and Deſolations? The Drs. Inference is, <hi>And if God may permit ſuch wickedneſs and violence, without being a Party to their wickedneſs, much more may he over-rule their wickedneſs for wiſe ends, and make them Executioners of his Juſtice, in puniſhing a wicked Age, and transferring Kingdoms,</hi> that is to ſay, As God by permitting the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men, is not a party to their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo neither is he by over-ruling it. Right! But where is the Conſequence, and therefore the entitling Uſurpation to his Authority, is not making him a Party to their wickedneſs; he adds indeed, <hi>And then why may not God give them thoſe Kingdoms he hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by them?</hi> This is the only Point, and it is dwindled into a Queſtion: And the very Queſtion deſtroys all that is ſaid before. God may give them thoſe Kingdoms if he pleaſe: But then if he does, this is not <hi>over-ruling</hi> wickedneſs, but conferring a juſt Title; and God indeed is not a Party to their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe they are Righteous Poſſeſſors. But then we are never the nearer to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: The Queſtion ſtill returns, Is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in oppoſition to common Right, ſuch a Gift? So that all this while, we are but where we were. The Dr. gives a Reaſon, <hi>For I ſuppoſe it is as agreeable to the Sovereignty, Wiſdom and Juſtice of God, to give a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to a Violent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, as to ſuffer a Wicked, Impious and Tyrannical Prince to aſcend the Throne with a Legal Title, which,</hi> ſays he, <hi>God often does.</hi> Now here are two things to be obſerv'd.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God may give a Kingdom to an Uſurper, if he pleaſe, as well as he did to <hi>Jehu;</hi> but
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107829:64"/> then when he hath given it him, ſuch Gift extinguiſhes his Uſurpation, and he juſtly and honeſtly poſſeſſes it; and whatever wickedneſs he might be guilty of before, it is none to wear that Crown which God gives him. So that indeed in ſuch a Caſe God is not a Party to their wickedneſs; but the Reaſon is not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>God permits wickedneſs with a farther deſign,</hi> or becauſe he <hi>over-rules it, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his own wiſe ends;</hi> but becauſe it is not Wickedneſs and Injuſtice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What the Dr. brings for a Parallel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes him. <hi>God may permit an Impious and Tyrannical Prince to aſcend the Throne,</hi> and he may likewiſe permit him to <hi>ravage</hi> and <hi>depopulate,</hi> with a <hi>farther deſign to over-rule them to accompliſh his own holy and juſt purpoſes.</hi> But then this does not give God's Authority, to his <hi>Impious</hi> and <hi>Tyrannical Acts.</hi> And I would fain ſee a good reaſon, why God's having a <hi>farther deſign in permitting wickedneſs,</hi> and <hi>over-ruling</hi> it, gives his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation,</hi> any more than it does to <hi>Tyranny?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the truth is, the Drs. account here furniſheth us with admirable meaſures of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Righteouſneſs; and let us tranſlate this Doctrine to other matters of Providence beſides Government, and ſee then how it looks; and this we may do by the Drs. allowance: for he tells us, it is <hi>an argument not only againſt God's making Kings, but againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in general.</hi> And therefore <hi>I ſuppoſe, no man will deny, but God may give the <hi>goods of this world</hi> to whom he pleaſe, he may <hi>take them from one, and give them to another</hi> without injuſtice, the only diſpute can be about God's bringing this to paſs by the wickedneſs of men; and what hurt is there in this, if God can over-rule the <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> and <hi>rapine</hi> of men, as to do that in purſuit of their own luſts, which God for wiſe and holy reaſons thinks fit to have done: ſuppoſe a <hi>wicked and cunning man,</hi> ſpurr'd on by <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> whom God may permit by <hi>fraud and violence to wrong and oppreſs all his neighbors,</hi> I ask any man, which moſt becomes the Divine Wiſdom, to ſuffer ſuch men, when they pleaſe, to <hi>ſpoil their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,</hi> only to gratifie their own luſts, or to give them ſucceſs when he ſees fit to chaſtize and puniſh <hi>ſuch perſons in their goods or eſtates.</hi> I am ſure this much more becomes the Wiſdom and Juſtice of Providence, than a bare permiſſion of ſuch violence, without any farther deſign. And if God may permit ſuch wickedneſs, without being a party to it, much more may he over-rule it for wiſe ends, and make them the Executioners of his Juſtice, in puniſhing <hi>wicked people.</hi> And then why may not God give them thoſe <hi>Goods or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,</hi> which he hath <hi>taken away</hi> by them? For I ſuppoſe, it is as agreeable to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, Wiſdom and Juſtice of God, to give <hi>ſuch Goods or Eſtates</hi> to a violent <hi>Robber or Oppreſſor,</hi> as to ſuffer a <hi>Legal Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to riot and revel, to ſpend them upon his Luſts and Vices, or to make them</hi> Inſtruments of Injury and Injuſtice?</hi> And is not this pure Doctrine, and admirably ſuited for the advancement of Righteouſneſs? And it is notwithſtanding the true ſtate of the Drs. Arguments here; for ſuch reaſonings extend equally to all Caſes of Providence, to the Caſe of private property, as well as to that of Crowns and Scepters: And the whole Scheme is as applicable to one Caſe as well as the other. The Dr. tells me upon another occaſion,<note place="margin">P. 51.</note> which I here return him, <hi>he may if he pleaſe, call this</hi> giving account of Providence, <hi>but I doubt every body elſe will give it ſome other name; and I hope he himſelf, upon ſecond thoughts, will be aſham'd of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dr. repeats my charge againſt his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation again, <hi>That it juſtifies an unreaſonable and wicked do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 61.</note> 
               <hi>by making the Acts or permiſſions of Providence, a Rule for practice againſt Right and Juſtice:</hi> and ſays, <hi>as for Right and Juſtice, it has been conſider'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; let us now conſider, how far the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God may be the Rule for practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is indeed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>an impious Doctrine to juſtifie every action, and every cauſe which has ſucceſs; God many times proſpers very
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107829:65"/> evil deſigns, when he can ſerve any good end by them; and therefore to meaſure the good or evil of things, by external ſucceſs, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it is God's Cauſe which the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God proſpers, confounds the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Good and Evil, and deſtroys all the ſtanding Rules of Right and Juſtice.</hi> Now the Drs. <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> is this very ſame <hi>impious Doctrine.</hi> For of two Perſons claiming the Government, who is, and who is not King, who hath, and who hath not a Right to Allegiance: That the obligation of an Oath made to the Perſon of the Governor ceaſes, tho his Perſon and his Legal Right be ſtill in being. That 'tis neceſſary, and a duty, to take an Oath contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to that, to another Perſon; all this is purely to be determin'd by Providence, without any manner of other Right or Title, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a plain and known Rule, acknowledg'd by the Dr. himſelf, and by all the world. And if this be not to make <hi>external ſucceſs the meaſure of Good and Evil,</hi> and <hi>to conclude, that to be God's Cauſe, which is proſper'd by Providence,</hi> I wiſh the Dr. would tell me, what is. And if he pleaſe likewiſe to favour me with the Solution of this Queſtion, Whether Uſurpation be God's Cauſe? if it be, whether the Dr. hath any other proof of it, beſides ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſucceſs, and the Providence of God proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering it? if it be not God's Cauſe, what can juſtifie our ſwearing to abett, ſupport and maintain it? So that either the Dr. muſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this <hi>Impious Doctrine,</hi> that God's Cauſe is to be meaſured by <hi>Succeſs</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> or another as <hi>impious,</hi> that we are bound in Conſcience, to do the utmoſt to maintain that which is not <hi>God's Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>yet it is ſo far from being an impious Doctrine; that it is a neceſſary duty, to conform our ſelves to the Divine Providence, and to diſcharge thoſe duties and obligations, which the Providence of God lays on us, according to the nature and intention of the Providence:</hi> Now if by the <hi>nature and intention of Providence,</hi> the Dr. means, that God by ſuch a <hi>Providence,</hi> intends to lay ſuch duties on us, it is true enough, and we are bound to conform our ſelves to the Divine Providence, and to diſcharge thoſe duties: as when God by his Providence puts us into a ſtate of affliction, it is our duty to conform our ſelves to his will, and to perform the Duties that Providence points out to us by that diſpenſation, to be patient, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and faithful, to be ſure to keep a good Conſcience, and not be affrighted from our duty, nor diſcourag'd in the practice of it. Theſe are duties that are conſequent upon ſuch a ſtate, and which the Divine Providence directs us to, and the nature and intention of the Providence, is plain and evident. But this is not at all to his purpoſe. But if by <hi>the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and intention of Providence,</hi> the Dr. means, that what things come to paſs in the world by Providence, it is our duty, and the intention of Providence, that we ſhould comply actively with them, own them, and adhere to them. <hi>This is manifeſtly falſe in a thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi> and particularly in all Robberies, Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, and Invaſions of other mens Rights. The Queſtion therefore is not, Whether we are to conform our ſelves to Providence, and to diſcharge duties according to the nature and intention of Providence; but whether it be the intention of Providence, that we are to eſpouſe, and embrace, and purſue the intereſt of Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, and all other Events that are manifeſtly unjuſt and unrighteous. The Queſtion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtill returns, What are the Duties and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, that the Providence of God lays on us, and what are the Intentions of Providence? Does God when he permits wicked and unjuſt Uſurpations, and other Villanies, require us to fall down and reverence, to joyn our ſelves to them, and to plead the Cauſe of Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs? This is to interpret Gods Providence in contradiction to his Laws: But what is all this to Providence being a Rule, which the Dr. ſaid he would conſider, how far it might be? He adds, <hi>Thus the Providence of God, in ſome ſenſe may be the Rule of our Practice, and may make that our duty which was not; and that ceaſe to be our duty, which was ſo before. And thus it always is, when the Providence of God changes our Relations, or condition of life, as in the preſent caſe, when he removes one King, and ſets up another; for he muſt transfer my Allegiance, when he changes my King:</hi> that is to ſay, when a Woman is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, ſhe is obliged to the duties of a Wife;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107829:65"/> when her Husband is dead, Providence hath ſet her free, and ſhe owes her dead Husband no duty: So, when God removes a King, the duty of Subjects ceaſe; and when they have another Lawful King, they owe him Allegiance. Very true. But the Queſtion returns, When is a King remov'd? Is diſpoſſeſſion, making him no King, and diſcharging the Subjects Duty? or is poſſeſſion, making the Uſurper a King, and obliging the Subjects? or is that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of providence? The Providence of God, changes Relations; but diſpoſſeſſion and diſtance, is no change of Relation. A Woman is not free by every providential removal of her Husband from her, but by ſuch a Providence only, as puts an end to his Life or Right: nor are Subjects free by every providential removal of their King, but by ſuch a Providence only, as puts an end to his Right and Title: And on the contrary, if a man ſets himſelf in the place of a Husband, the hand of Providence is not to be own'd, nor is he to be ſubmitted to as a Husband of Divine Right: A providential Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is no Husband, but an Adulterer; and a providential King is no King, but an Uſurper. And as to Providence being a Rule in any caſe,<note place="margin">Vind. p 44.</note> the Dr. hath urged theſe very things before, which I have already anſwer'd, and ſhall not need to repeat.</p>

               <hi>is the fault of my Caſe of Allegiance: for ſome men cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to hear, God makes Kings; for that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, there is a God.</hi> A fine way of calling his Adverſaries <hi>Atheiſts.</hi> And ſo on he goes in the Rallying ſtrain, <hi>had he ſaid any thing elſe, he might have eſcaped as well as his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; but ſince he hath entitled God to the matter, this ſpoils all, and is an impious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: And if that be his fault, he is content to ſuffer obloquy and reproach, for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch impious Doctrines.</hi> Now if the Dr. can <hi>rally</hi> off the Abſurdity and Impiety of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine about Providence, much good may it do him; I ſhall leave ſuch arguments to take their chance. And I do not believe the Dr. has ſo mean an opinion of his Readers, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any great wonders from them but ſuch things, though they are not likely to convin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, yet they may amuze, and ſerve for a <hi>blind</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the perceiving the force of the argument againſt him, and the weakneſs of his Anſwer; whether the Dr. had any ſuch end, by this long Excurſion, he knows beſt. But however it comes to paſs, my anſwer to him is perfectly loſt, and we have not here the leaſt word of it, nor the leaſt intimation, as if the Dr. knew of any ſuch thing. And therefore I ſhall beg the Reader's Patience to lay it before him. It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows in the <hi>Poſtſcript.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dr. had raiſed an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his Hypotheſis,<note place="margin">Poſtſcript, p. 13. Caſe of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg. p. 34.</note> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Have not Pyrats and Robbers as good a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to my Purſe, as an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper to the Crown? Does not the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God order and diſpoſe of all theſe Events?</hi> To which he anſwer, <hi>the diſpute is not about Humane and Legal Right in either caſe, but about Authority, now no man pretends, that Thieves and Pyrats have God's Authority.</hi> To this I anſwer'd, What is this to the purpoſe? I know Thieves and Robbers have not God's Authority, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath an Uſurper: but have they not God's Providence, as well as an Uſurper? And if Poſſeſſion of <hi>Authority</hi> by Providence, gives a Right to it, Why does not the Poſſeſſion of <hi>my Purſe</hi> by the ſame Providence, give a Right to it? The Dr. puts it into the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>Have not Robbers as</hi> good <hi>a Title to my Purſe, as an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, to the Crown?</hi> And it is certain, they have as <hi>good a Title;</hi> for they have the very ſame I grant, <hi>taking a Purſe,</hi> and <hi>taking Authority,</hi> are two things, and ſo are alſo <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation</hi> and <hi>Right:</hi> But the Queſtion is about Providence, and that is the ſame; he that takes a <hi>Purſe,</hi> takes it by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as well as he that takes a <hi>Throne,</hi> and if Providence gives a Right, the one hath it, as well as the other. But the Scripture (ſaith the Dr.) expreſly tells us, <hi>that Kingdoms are diſpos'd of by God, that all power is of God;</hi> and does not the ſame Scripture tell us, <hi>that the Earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof;</hi> that he diſpoſes of it, as he pleaſes: that when <hi>Job</hi> was rob'd, he ſaid, <hi>the Lord hath taken away.</hi> But if the Scripture had not ſaid ſo, the Dr. ſays it; for he tells us, all Events are God's Act and Deed; and then it muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107829:66"/> that the poſſeſſion of my Purſe by a Thief, is as much God's Decree and Council, as the poſſeſſion of the Throne. The Doctor founds all this in <hi>God's Creation: God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the natural Lord of the World,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe he made it, and no Creature hath any Right to govern the World, or any part of it, but as he receives Authority from God:</hi> And is not this the ſame, in all other reſpects? Are not all mens Eſtates Gods, as well as Authority? And has any man a Right to his Eſtate, but what God gives him? And does it thence follow, that whatever any man can get by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, tho it be never ſo much againſt the Laws and Common Right, it is his own, becauſe God is not ty'd to Humane Laws, and hath a Right to the World by Creation, and may give it whom he pleaſe? And I wonder, what reaſon there is, that 'tis a more certain ſign to us, that the poſſeſſion of power by providence, gives any more Right to it, th n the poſſeſſion of Goods or an Eſtate gives a Right to them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Of all this, the Dr. hath not thought fit to take any notice. He tells us indeed, before,<note place="margin">P. 58.</note> 
               <hi>that he had already ſtated the matter about right and juſtice, and had ſhewn the difference between the right of private men to their Eſtates, and of Princes to their Thrones, between a Thiefs taking a Purſe, and an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper a Crown, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God,</hi> &amp;c. Now I confeſs, this he had ſaid upon another occaſion; and when the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce of my argument lay another way; but he ought to have conſidered my anſwer here. For here it was that he himſelf rais'd the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and anſwers it: and my anſwer directly affects him, and his whole Hypotheſis: or if he would not reply to it in its proper place, he ought at leaſt to have took notice of the force of it: he tells us, <hi>he ſhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>'d the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a Thiefs taking a Purſe, and an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper a Throne:</hi> but where hath he ſhew'd any difference with <hi>reſpect to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?</hi> Why, a Thief hath not <hi>as good</hi> a Title to my Purſe, as an Uſurper to the Throne, when he hath the very ſame: Where hath he ſhew'd any difference with reſpect to God's right by Creation? which is the foundation of his Hypotheſis, and which affects all private Eſtates, as well as Government and Authority. And where hath he ſhew'd any difference in the Evidence, that a Providential Poſſeſſion of Power, is a more <hi>certain ſign</hi> to us of God's Gift, and a Divine Right, than the ſame Providential Poſſeſſion of Goods or an Eſtate? This is the force of my Anſwer, which he hath taken no manner of notice of, and which would have been evident, had he anſwer'd this in its proper place. But if he had not been pleas'd to anſwer it, he might have beſtow'd ſome of his complements upon it, and have call'd it a <hi>Jeſt,</hi> or a <hi>Banter,</hi> or ſomething, as he does other arguments he cannot tell what to do with.</p>
            <p>He proceeds to conſider another of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments againſt the interpretation he gives of the ſenſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,<note place="margin">Vind. p. 63.</note> 
               <hi>That it is inconſiſtent with their main and fundamental Doctrines,</hi> viz. <hi>Paſſive Obedience, and Non-Reſiſtance.</hi> He replys, <hi>But if the Convocation taught both</hi> (as certainly they did) <hi>it is a ſign that whatever our Author thinks, or whatever he can prove the Convocation did not apprehend any inconſiſtency between them.</hi> Now me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, the Dr. might a little have conſider'd my argument, and not have given ſuch a ſhort anſwer; eſpecially when he complains ſo much of concealing what he ſays. The ſum of all was, that <q>that interpretation of a <hi>thorough Settlement,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to the Pamphl. p. 21.</note> which beſt agrees with <hi>Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> we are in juſtice bound to believe, that it is the ſenſe of the Convocation, as beſt agreeing with their fundamental Doctrines and the main deſign of the <hi>Convocation.</hi> And to ſay that a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is <hi>thoroughly ſettled,</hi> when it hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd a Right by Preſcription, or the extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and ſubmiſſion of the Right Heir, does not in the leaſt interfere with the Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience;</hi> but when a Perſon hath got full poſſeſſion of power, and the lawful King is alive, and is ſo far from ſubmitting, that he actually conteſts his Right, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Allegiance of his Subjects in order to it; to ſay that they muſt quit their Lawful King, become Subjects to the poſſeſſor, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all their Allegiance and Duty to him, do all they can to eſtabliſh him in the Poſſeſſion,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107829:66"/> and as much to keep the other out, become irreconcilable and mortal enemies to him, and if need be to fight againſt him, and kill him; (for all theſe neceſſarily follow from that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) This is ſuch a notion of <hi>Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> as never was heard on.</q> And what now is the Drs. ſhort Anſwer to all this, why it is <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> the Convocation thought this was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Paſſive Obedience, that is, they <hi>thought</hi> and <hi>taught,</hi> that men for the intereſt of an Uſurper, might fight againſt and kill the Rightful King to whom they had ſworn Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance; and at the ſame time when they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Legal Right to be in him; which if any man that reads the Convocation can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he may believe any thing in the World, and one would have thought the Dr. ſhould have ſhewed us how this was reconcilable with <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> before he had ſo dogmita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally aſſerted, that the Convocation taught it. And this is abſolutely neceſſary to juſtifie his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, for the main deſign of the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was to aſſert the Doctrine of Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and that is plain and evident, and if the notion of a <hi>thorough Settlement</hi> was not ſo evident, their notion of Paſſive Obedience is to regulate and direct to their ſenſe of a thorough Settlement, and not the notion of a thorough Settlement to direct to their ſenſe of Paſſive Obedience: And therefore if the Drs. notion of a thorough Settlement be not reconcilable with Paſſive Obedience, it cannot be their ſenſe; except we can alſo believe that they contradict the main Deſign, and the Fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their whole Book. But the Dr. tells us, <hi>I obſerv'd in the Caſe, that the Doctrine of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Allegiance to the Preſent Powers is founded on the ſame Principles, with the Doctrine of Non-Reſiſtance and Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, viz. that God makes Kings and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſts them with his Authority, which equally proves, that all Kings who have received a Sovereign Authority from God, muſt be obeyed, and muſt not be reſiſted;</hi> Right, he does ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this, but then he hath left out in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating it, that upon which the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie turns, and yet at the ſame time complains of <hi>concealing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caſe of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg. p. 36.</note> and that is, <hi>and are in the actual adminiſtration of it (which is the only evidence we have, that they have received it from God.</hi> For what tho Paſſive Obedience be due to God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; is it therefore due to Uſurpation and actual Adminiſtration which is not God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? and (to uſe ſome of the Drs. expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) <hi>He may harangue upon this Argument, as long as he pleaſes;</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 64.</note> unleſs he can prove, that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſts every Uſurper with his Authority, while the Rightful King is living and claiming. And that he does not do ſo, is manifeſt from this very Doctrine <hi>of Paſſive Obedience: For the Doctrine of Non-Reſiſtance and Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is founded on an irreſiſtable Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; conſider then what are the Rights of an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable Authority, and what the duties of Paſſive Obedience.</hi> 1. <hi>The Rights of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and irreſiſtable Authority are, that he cannot forfeit his Crown, that he cannot be judged nor depoſed by his Subjects; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when once King, he is always ſo 'till death or a voluntary and legal Reſignation.</hi> 2. <hi>Non-Reſiſtance does not merely ſignifie not to fight againſt the King, but</hi> 1. <hi>That upon no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence we muſt renounce his Right, and</hi> 2. <hi>Muſt never ſet his Crown upon anothers head.</hi> 3. <hi>Muſt not transfer our Allegiance to another.</hi> Now the Dr. will not except againſt this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine for the ſake of its Author, and he may pleaſe to obſerve, that we are not ſo apt to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi> as he is to <hi>forget,</hi> and he may trie if he can ſolve the matter by his diſtinction between <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Faction.</hi> But if this be the caſe, then theſe things neceſſarily follow. 1. That <hi>Transferring of Paſſive Obedience</hi> from the Rightful King to the Uſurper, is a Propoſition inconſiſtent with it ſelf, and made up of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> ſignifies one thing, and <hi>transferring</hi> it the clean contrary. And to talk of <hi>transferring Paſſive Obedience</hi> is juſt as if we ſhould ſay <hi>fighting Non-Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> or <hi>Rebellious Allegiance.</hi> 2. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience equally affects his interpretation of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as his interpretation of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> for Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Obedience, is as evidently and plainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by the Scriptures, as by the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and for the proof of this, I refer my ſelf to Dr. <hi>Sherlocks Caſe of Reſiſtance.</hi> And if his interpretation of Scripture be irreconcilab e with the Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience, then it
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107829:67"/> is not reconcil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble with Scripture, and then it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ot true, and if to fight againſt and kill a King, to whom we have ſworn Allegiance and whom we ſtill acknowledge to have a Legal Right and Title, be not Paſſive Obedience, then the Drs. expounding the 13th to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Powers,</hi> in oppoſition to a <hi>

                  </gap>tful King</hi> is not the ſenſe of Scripture, but his own private ſenſe; it is not ſufficient here to ſay <hi>it is certain they teach both;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo e they are not inconſiſtent, for that is prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things the wrong way, for <hi>it is certain</hi> they do not teach both i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they are inconſiſtent. And therefore if the Dr. would regularly prove, that they do teach both, he ought to have made it appear by ſhewing they are not inconſiſtent, and not come off with a ſhort reply, <hi>it is certain</hi> they do ſo.</p>
            <p>My next Argument is, <hi>That this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation repreaches the Virtue and Loyalty of thoſe admirable men, who ſuffered between the years</hi> 42 <hi>and</hi> 60. The Dr. replies, <hi>and therefore it cannot be the ſenſe of the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, for no doubt the Convocation in</hi> 603. <hi>had great regard to the Loyalty of theſe who ſuffered between</hi> 42. <hi>and</hi> 60. <hi>by a ſpirit of Prophecy I ſuppoſe.</hi> A very wiſe obſervation! And why might not the Convocation in 603. have regard to the Loyalty of the members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in 42. or 60. or 90 ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? if they deſign'd their Book as a direction for practice, it muſt regard future time, as well 42. as 603. and as well 90 as 42. But the Dr. knows well enough the Queſtion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Principle of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and here we have a body of men, undoubted Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and as great and eminent for piety and virtue as that Church ever bred; and moſt of them living at the time of this Convocation, and ſome of them proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly members of it: And here was a Caſe, where their ſenſe of this Principle was tried to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; and beſides their plain Doctrines, their ſufferi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gs were a convincing Teſtimony, that they did not believe, that the Drs. notion of a thorough Settlement was any Principle of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And conſidering all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, this brings the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute almoſt down to our very ſenſes.<note place="margin">Anſwers to the Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, p. 22.</note> As I ſaid, <q>it would have been thought madneſs for a Church of <hi>England</hi> man to have doubted, who (in the late times) acted moſt agreeably to the Principles of that Church in the point of Alleg. and Government, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Juxton,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Cozens,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> &amp;c. or <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> or <hi>John Goodwin,</hi> or whether the <hi>Regicides</hi> were Church of <hi>England</hi> men too, in the ſame points, &amp;c.</q> So that with the Drs. leave this Argument does not lye ſo far off, as to need any <hi>Prophecy</hi> to make it good, but is plain; ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and natural; and ſeeing we are about the interpretation of a Church of <hi>England</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, from whom are we moſt likely to learn it, from the Doctrines and Practices of thoſe excellent men, and who gave ſuch illuſtrious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of their own ſenſe of it, or from <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Bradſhaw, Marſhall</hi> or <hi>Milton?</hi> and I ſhall crave leave to believe (except the Dr. can give me ſome better Reaſons) that the <hi>Virtue and Loyalty of thoſe admirable men,</hi> are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter interpreters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, then the <hi>villany and wickedneſs</hi> of thoſe Advocates for Uſurpation. But theſe, it ſeems, are <hi>hard and ſpightful words,</hi> which the Dr. tells me, I <hi>give to my Adverſaries:</hi> That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is very eaſily ſaid, but it had been much fairer to have given a plain and rational anſwer to them.</p>
            <p>Concerning this the Dr. ſaid, <hi>it is a great prejudice but no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Poſtſcript. p. 14.</note> 
               <hi>nor can be formed into an Argument:</hi> I anſwered, <hi>I thought an Argument from example had been an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, tho not always a very good one.</hi> He replies <hi>Right!</hi> what and cannot be formed into an Argument?<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 64.</note> That is a little ſtrange, but the Dr. to avoid that repeats another ſentence, not that which I anſwered, I ſuppoſe by virtue of <hi>keeping his own Order and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod;</hi> and I would fain know how that is an Argument, which cannot be form'd into an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. This agrees like the reſt of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Well! He tells us, <hi>Example is only a prejudice not an Argument againſt plain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which cannot otherwiſe be anſwered: Let Reaſons be firſt anſwered, and then when there is no Reaſon againſt a thing, the example of great and wiſe men without any other reaſon, carry ſome Authority with them; eſpecially
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107829:67"/> when we have other good reaſons for doing any thing, example gives ſome more ſtrength. And thus the example of</hi> Jaddus <hi>may be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when other examples are none.</hi> The meaning is, that an example againſt the Drs. <hi>Reaſons</hi> is a Prejudice and no Argument, and an example the Dr. mentions againſt other mens Reaſons, is an Argument and no Prejudice; for I had urged againſt him his producing the example of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> which was but a ſingle and a ſuſpicious example. But that it ſeems muſt be an <hi>Argument,</hi> becauſe it is for the Drs. turn, but the examples of ſo many excellent men are but <hi>Prejudices,</hi> becauſe they make againſt him. But by the Drs. favour the examples of theſe great and good men, is an <hi>Argument</hi> and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong one to prove the ſenſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the point of Submiſſion to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Powers,</hi> and ſuch a one as confutes all the Drs. little Reaſons to the contrary: He urges ſome Arguments to prove the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> on his ſide; and to theſe we oppoſe the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident and undoubted practice of that Church, in ſuch remarkable and diſcriminating inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as plainly diſtinguiſhed between thoſe that were true Sons of that Church, and thoſe that were not ſo; and to talk of Reaſons againſt plain matter of fact, is diſputing againſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, and ſuch reaſons are like the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt motion, which are beſt confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by walking up and down. But ſays he, <hi>tho he knows the example of</hi> Jaddus <hi>was alledged by me, only to prove the ſenſe of the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and the Dr. knows theſe great examples were alledged by me for the ſame Reaſon. He adds, <hi>and how</hi> Jaddus <hi>himſelf underſtood his Oath of Allegiance to</hi> Darius, <hi>which ſaith he, is a very different caſe from what he urges;</hi> yes by all means! The examples of thoſe great men did not prove how they <hi>underſtood the Oath of Allegiance;</hi> nor what they thought of ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Uſurped Powers in Poſſeſſion againſt a Legal King out of Poſſeſſion, nor what was the ſenſe of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in thoſe Caſes: I ſuppoſe, becauſe ſome of them loſt their lives, and all their livelyhoods and Eſtates againſt their own ſenſe and judgment, and againſt the ſenſe and direction of that Church of which they profeſſed themſelves, and were in truth the moſt eminent and faithful Members.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to let paſs his tranſport of zeal, and to forgive the</hi> froth <hi>and</hi> folly <hi>of it.</hi> (Theſe I ſuppoſe the Dr. deſigns for <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>obliging</hi> expreſſions, for he had but juſt before complain'd of my <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>ſpightful</hi> words) <hi>when he urges the examples of theſe great men there are many things he ought to have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>He ſhould have conſidered whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, as well as whom he commended.</hi> Right! and I did ſo, but he tells us, <hi>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches all thoſe who in thoſe times of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſubmitted to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Powers, and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quietly and peaceably under them.</hi> But who told him ſo? there is no ſuch thing in my <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> or <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> is there no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween living <hi>peaceably and quietly,</hi> and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parties to the Uſurpation, ſiding with it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Legal King, pleading the Cauſe of it, and <hi>ſwearing to be true and faithful to it?</hi> Theſe laſt indeed are <hi>reproached</hi> by the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Loyalty of thoſe excellent men, and who can help that? Virtue and Truth is always a <hi>Reproach</hi> to Vice and Error. But perhaps the Dr would have had me juſtified the excluſion of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> and the adherence to the Uſurpers againſt him. And this indeed would not have <hi>reproached them.</hi> But it would have <hi>reproached</hi> much honeſter and better men than they; it would have <hi>reproached</hi> all thoſe Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and Loyal Sufferers for their King and the Laws. But no matter for them, they are not for the Drs purpoſe now; but he is grown on a ſudden ſo very tender of the Uſurpers Party, that they muſt ſuffer no reproach, and rather than that, the beſt men of our Church muſt not be commended for fear it ſhould reflect on them. But ſaith the Dr. <hi>The King found a great many true Friends and Loyal Perſons at his return among thoſe men.</hi> I ſuppoſe by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their taking the <hi>Engagement,</hi> and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Books to keep him out, and uſing all their endeavours and intereſts for that purpoſe. Well, but ſuppoſe <hi>ſome of them</hi> were <hi>true friends</hi> to the King; why then they are not to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,</hi> not for their being Parties to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation againſt him, but becauſe they were his <hi>true friends.</hi> i. e. becauſe they deſerted the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers;</hi> for they could not be true Friends and Loyal to both. And if I have ſaid any thing to reproach them for being the Kings friends,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107829:68"/> and abandoning his Enemies, I am content to ſuffer reproach my ſelf. But as the Dr. hath worded this, it is not eaſie to underſtand what he means: He ſays they were <hi>true Friends</hi> and <hi>Loyal Perſons</hi> upon his return. Does he mean that were <hi>then</hi> ſo only, but before his return and in the time of Uſurpation were virulent and mortal Enemies to him, but ſo ſoon as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd they became <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Loyal.</hi> Methinks this is no extraordinary character: They were his friends, when he could advance them, but in his extremity and when he had need of them they were his enemies; i. e. they were true friends to themſelves and not to him, and ſuch a kind of friendſhip, if it muſt not be reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, does not ſure deſerve commendation. The Dr. further tells me, I <hi>reproach all thoſe Loyal Perſons, who ſuffered under thoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations and comply now:</hi> And alſo, <hi>all thoſe who have now ſworn Allegiance.</hi> But how can the Dr. tell that? I meddle with no bodies Principles but his, and the Dr. in the next paragraph tells me, <hi>I ought not only to conſider what was done, but upon what Principles they did it;</hi> and I have conſidered his Principles, and have ſhewn, that they reproach the beſt Men of our Church; but that it ſeems will not do, and I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider <hi>what was done</hi> alſo, and <hi>reproach</hi> all them that did it, tho they act upon other Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and tho I conſider no bodies Principles but the Drs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next Advice is, <hi>If our Author will argue from Examples, he ought not only to conſider what was done, but upon what Principles they did it, whether they were all of our Authors mind, that it is abſolutely unlawful in any caſe whatſoever to ſubmit to a Prince, who is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the Throne, while the Legal King, or his true Heir is living, tho diſpoſſeſſed.</hi> Now I think there is all the evidence in the World that they were of this mind: This was the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry caſe, there was a Perſon (the Dr. may call him <hi>Prince</hi> if he pleaſes and agreeable enough to his Principles) <hi>poſſeſſed</hi> of the Throne, and the Legal King and Heir <hi>diſpoſſeſſed.</hi> And it is plain in fact they refuſed to ſubmit to the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the Throne, and adhered to the Legal King out of the Throne. And if the Dr. can find any other reaſon or aſſertion of theirs for this practice, beſides the <hi>abſolute unlawfulneſs</hi> of owning the Uſurper, he would do well to produce it. He ſays, <hi>it is probable ſome few might be of his mind.</hi> But why does not he name one ſingle man of them that was not of this mind? that he can never do, nor does he in the leaſt undertake it. But boldly affirms, <hi>that it can never be proved, and it is very improbable, for it was neither the Doctrine of the Church, nor the Law of the Land.</hi> But that is the matter in diſpute, and by what Rules of <hi>Logick</hi> is the grand matter in controverſie brought for a proof? The Queſtion is whether it be the Doctrine of the Church, or Law of the Land; and the practice of thoſe great men is urged againſt the Drs. interpretation, and is a proof againſt him; and how comes the thing to be proved, to be brought in proof againſt that which proves it againſt him? But this is uſual with him. But ſays he, <hi>that it was their general ſenſe (that it</hi> was abſolutely unlawful to ſubmit to the Uſurper, while the Legal King is living tho out of Poſſeſſion) <hi>can never be proved.</hi> No? that is very ſtrange, the Aſſertion is plain enough in Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and all them that wrot upon the point; and one would have thought the practice of all the reſt was a very good proof of their Sentiments in this matter; can any man believe, that men would loſe their lives and eſtates, and expoſe themſelves to the greateſt difficulties and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities for not doing what they thought they lawfully might do? And in ſuch a caſe to call for proofs is to abuſe mens patience, and in the Drs. language <hi>argues great perverſeneſs of mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all the whole advice in this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph is nothing to the purpoſe, I brought the examples of theſe great men, againſt the Drs. Principles and Interpretations; and he adviſes me to conſider, whether they acted upon my Principles; and what is that to the purpoſe? if the Dr. can prove they did not act upon my Principles, or that they acted upon Principles that are contrary to them, I am contented to own that their examples is an argument againſt my Principles, as they are now againſt his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. But this he will not meddle with, and inſtead of that, he is for adviſing me (I thank him) to prove it my ſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another thing I ought to have conſider'd, he ſays is, <hi>when he reſolved to argue from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, he ſhould have carefully conſidered,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107829:68"/> whether there are not more and greater exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples on the other ſide, whether ſuppoſing the Caſe to be as he repreſents it, there be any thing like it in all ſtory either ſacred or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, whether both</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Chriſtians <hi>did not always ſubmit to the Preſent Powers, when the Government was ſetled by what wicked means ſoever it began.</hi> Now the Caſe which the Dr. repreſents, and which I diſpute againſt, is the lawfulneſs of ſubmitting to, and joyning with Uſurped Powers in oppoſition to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal King, when out of Poſſeſſion and claiming and inſiſting upon his Right: And I had over and over provoked him, to give any approved inſtances of any men that own'd his <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> And when he cannot be prevailed upon to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one ſingle inſtance and example: To tell me, <hi>I ought to conſider whether there are not more and greater examples on the other ſide</hi> is extraordinary: If there be more and greater examples, why does not he ſhew them, and clear his Hypotheſis from the charge of Singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Parodox? But when he does not name one, nor ſo much as offer at it, when he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly tells me, <hi>he ſhall not enter upon this Argument,</hi> but turns me over to ſome body elſe that will do wonders in this point no man knows when; to talk of <hi>more and greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,</hi> and the practice of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which his Reader muſt find out as well as he can, and to confront the moſt plain and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible examples with imaginary ones, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices in the Clouds; And after all the urging and provocation to name not one, and yet ſtill to inſiſt upon it, and cry there are <hi>more</hi> and <hi>greater.</hi> This is ſuch a way of <hi>vindicating</hi> as is as new as his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and very well agrees with it, and if this be diſputing we ſhall never have done.</p>
            <p>Now the Dr. comes to conſider what I had ſaid further upon this head, I ſaid, <q>the Dr. owns that this is a Prejudice, and ſo it is,<note place="margin">Poſtſ. p. 14.</note> and a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable one; and I wonder what he hath ſaid to remove it, not one word to the purpoſe; he tells indeed of ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, but not one that is any difference as to the matter before us,</q> of <hi>Submiſſion to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Powers,</hi> and he replies, <hi>let us then try that.</hi> And in order to that he begins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to ſtate the matter ſo plain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 66.</note> 
               <hi>that our Author himſelf had he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much mind to it, ſhall not be able to miſtake or miſrepreſent it.</hi> And have I miſtaken or miſrepreſented it? That the Dr. would inſinuate, but then he ſhould have told me where and in what inſtances; that it ſeems is another Queſtion; however the Dr. is reſolved to have it ſo, or would perſwade a credulous Reader to believe it, tho he hath not named one particular wherein I have miſtaken or miſrepreſented him; and this will appear more fully upon examining what he ſays in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; he tells us, <hi>he muſt firſt premiſe that they are two different Queſtions, when it is lawful to ſubmit to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurping Powers, and when 'tis a duty: 'tis lawful when we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der force as can compel us; 'tis a duty when the Government is throughly ſetled.</hi> Very well! This is the Drs. <hi>State of the matter</hi> now, but where hath he ſtated it ſo before? there is not a word of it, nor any ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction in his <hi>Caſe of Allegiance;</hi> and how then ſhould I know it? I ſuppoſe by Inſpiration? and it is a pretty way of miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and miſrepreſenting him, becauſe in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering his <hi>Caſe of Allegiance,</hi> I did not divine what he would ſay in his <hi>Vindication;</hi> But the truth is the Dr. <hi>miſtook,</hi> he found the former <hi>ſtate of the matter</hi> would not do, and if he had kept cloſe to that he could not have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered what had been objected to him, and therefore hath given a new ſtate of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. And he might have ſaid ſo, and not by an inſinuating preface, have laid his own <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes</hi> at other mens doors. Let him ſhew me if he can, that he hath in this manner ſtated the Caſe in his former Book; if not, why does he talk of <hi>miſtaking</hi> and <hi>miſrepreſenting it?</hi> Well! let us take his new State, and ſee what he can make of it. He tells us, <hi>while we are in this ſtate</hi> (under force) <hi>we may either ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or not ſubmit without ſin, and then that which muſt turn the ſcale, are arguments from intereſt;</hi> and here is the ground of this new State, he had ſaid before, and it was objected to him,<note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg. p. 48. Poſtſ. p. 15.</note> 
               <hi>That the Friends of Monarchy were bound in</hi> Intereſt <hi>to reſtore the King.</hi> And he did not know how to get off from it without inventing this new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107829:69"/> which yet will not ſerve his turn; for having applied what he ſaid before to thoſe times of Uſurpation he adds; <hi>This is ſo far from leſſening and reproaching their Loyalty, that it is greatly for the commendation of it, that when they were not bound in conſcience to ſubmit to thoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations, tho by ſubmiſſion our Author intimates, they might have made better terms for themſelves, yet they rather choſe to venture their lives and fortunes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the King, which is not, as our Author inſinuates</hi> to prefer their intereſt to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences <hi>in ſerving the King; but where Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was not concerned to the contrary, to venture their</hi> intereſt, <hi>ther lives and fortunes to reſtore the King:</hi> Now here is a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſtate of the Caſe</p>
            <p>For 1. The Dr. tells us, in ſuch a ſtate <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is to turn the ſcale;</hi> and yet in the cloſe of his reply, he ſays, it was <hi>to venture their intereſts, lives and fortunes to reſtore the King;</hi> this looks very like a contradiction, for what does he mean by <hi>venturing their intereſts,</hi> but <hi>venturing</hi> the loſs of them. And thoſe who might have preſerved their <hi>intereſts</hi> by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Uſurpations; and which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Dr. it was lawful for them to do, choſe rather to <hi>venture their lives and fortunes to reſtore the King;</hi> i. e. in ſhort, they choſe rather to hazard their lives and intereſts, than to preſerve them. And if <hi>intereſt muſt turn the ſcale,</hi> it is plain enough, that whatever Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience did, intereſt lay on the ſide of Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And when ſo many of the Nobility, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Clergy, were utterly undone for their obſtinate Loyalty, in ſuch a Caſe to talk of mens being Loyal for <hi>intereſt</hi> is to contradict common ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Dr gives an admirable account of the Grounds and Reaſons, why the Royal Party did not ſubmit to thoſe Uſurpations, and that is not Conſcience but Intereſt; not but that they <hi>thought</hi> it lawful for them to ſubmit, but they refuſed it upon other accounts, even when they <hi>thought</hi> they lawfully might. But where had the Dr. this fine account? Is there the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of it in any hiſtory of thoſe times? in any Pamphlet or diſcourſe concerning it? or did ever any man beſides the Dr. ſay it? there were ſome indeed, that thought or pretended to think they were miſtaken, and they might <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> own thoſe Uſurpations, and the Drs. argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from providence was urged for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: But I think the Dr. is the firſt that ever affirm'd that they themſelves thought ſo. Their general arguments were drawn from the Duty of Allegiance, the obligation of their Oaths, and the Laws of the Land, which plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port they thought Conſcience was concerned, and that it was unlawful to own thoſe Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions This therefore is nothing but fancy and imagination, and the Dr. ſays it without any ground in the World. He may make reaſons for himſelf, and coin new diſtinctions to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie them, but what warrant has he to make reaſons for other men? It is no wonder he makes thus hold with the Convocation, who can faſten ſuch a ſenſe on the practices of thoſe <hi>loyal ſufferers,</hi> not only without any manner of foundation, but contrary to their expreſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations: if we muſt be making <hi>new Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſes,</hi> and framing <hi>new Schemes</hi> of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to juſtifie our ſelves, let us prove them as well as we can; but for ſhame let us never inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle other men to them, who plainly acted by different Principles, and have as plainly declared their ſenſe to the contrary; if the Dr. thinks this imputation ſevere, let him acquit himſelf from it, by ſhewing if he can, but ſome <hi>few</hi> among thoſe many Loyal Sufferers, who thought <hi>Conſcience</hi> was not concern'd in the Caſe, and that they thought it lawful to ſubmit, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Subjects to thoſe Uſurpations, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their Legal King.</p>
            <p>And this is yet more extravagant, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the diſmal circumſtances of thoſe times, and to how many difficulties and fatal miſeries, that Revolution expoſed the Loyal Party, a great part of which might have been prevented in particular men, if they would but have comply'd, and joyn'd themſelves to the Uſurpers. In ſuch a Caſe to Queſtion, whether they were acted by Principles of Conſcience, or to ſay that they thought Conſcience was not concern'd either way, is to ſcorn and abuſe their ſufferings, and makes them ſelf murderers, and deſtroyers, and lays all their deſolation and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in at their own doors; for what can ſuch men anſwer to God, themſelves, or their families, who ſuffer themſelves to be undone and periſh, when they might lawfully have prevented it. And this is that admirable Character the Dr. (to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:107829:69"/> ſave his own Hypotheſis) hath found out for theſe noble and conſcientious Sufferers: He was charg'd with <hi>reproaching their Vertue and Loyalty;</hi> and to get himſelf off that, he hath reproach'd them as much on the other hand.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Dr. diſtinguiſhes between <hi>when it is lawful, and when it is a duty to ſubmit,</hi> and applies this diſtinction to thoſe Uſurpations, thereby intimating, that it was <hi>lawful,</hi> tho not a <hi>duty,</hi> for the Loyal Party to ſubmit to them. The conſequence is, they had no obligation in conſcience to King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>ſecond;</hi> for if it was <hi>lawful</hi> for them to ſubmit and become Parties to the Uſurpation, it was likewiſe law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them to diſcharge themſelves of King <hi>Charles,</hi> for they could not be the Subjects of both, and then they were not bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to him; they might reſpect him for their own ends, and endeavour to reſtore him <hi>to better their condition</hi> (as the Dr. ſays) and for the ſake of their <hi>intereſt;</hi> but Duty they owed him none at all, they ow'd him juſt as much as they ow'd <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and no more. He was charged with reproaching their <hi>Vertue and Loyalty,</hi> and he hath now fairly compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd the matter, and made them have no <hi>Loyalty</hi> at all. For I pray what kind of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty is that which is no duty? They might love and reſpect the King, or rather them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but to be <hi>loyal</hi> to him they could not, for that ariſes from Duty and Obligation, and 'tis mere name and complement when there is none. And thus that renowned Loyalty which the world had in ſo much veneration, is ſunk into juſt nothing. Between the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts and the other Party the ſcales were even in point of Conſcience, advantage might turn the ſcales, and the whole is reſolv'd into ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs and private intereſt. And what a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous account is this of that glorious ſcene of invincible Fidelity, Fortitude and good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? It is much for the honor of an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis that it cannot be <hi>vindicated</hi> but at the expence of the glory and reputation due to the beſt Men and the beſt Practices: And which is yet more extraordinary, the Doctor would make us believe, <hi>that this is ſo far from leſſening and reproaching their Loyalty, that it is greatly for the commendation of it;</hi> yes ſure it is greatly for the <hi>commendation</hi> of a mans Loyalty, that he loves himſelf, and can <hi>better his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> by it. This may ſuit well enough with ſome mens <hi>Loyalty;</hi> but the <hi>Loyalty</hi> between 42 and 60 was quite of another make, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto the World hath thought that the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation</hi> of it conſiſted in ſuffering for their Fidelity, in parting with their Intereſts rather than their Loyalty, in ſubmitting to the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Circumſtances rather than violating their natural and ſworn Allegiance.</p>
            <p>The Dr. adds now, <hi>That they were not bound in conſcience to ſubmit to theſe Uſurpers.</hi> (The Queſtion is whether the Doctor's Principles and Arguments do not equally conclude for their Submiſſion to thoſe <hi>Uſurped Powers?</hi>) and this he ſays <hi>he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oved, becauſe their Government was never ſetled,</hi> i. e. according to his notion of a <hi>Settlement.</hi> And that is aga n according to one branch of it, a national conſent in Parliament or by the Peoples Repreſentatives. And here the Dr. takes a great deal of pains to prove that the <hi>Rump</hi> and <hi>Cromwell</hi> had no ſuch national conſent,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 40, 41.</note> and therefore their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not throughly ſetled. To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all the Doctor's Arguments equally conclude for Submiſſion to thoſe Uſurpations as to any other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they might be ſetled according to the Doctor's notion of a Settlement, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what he hath oppos'd to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all his Arguments equally conclude for Submiſſion to thoſe as to any other Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, though they had not the formal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the People. I ſhall mention two. His Arguments to prove his notion of a <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Settlement,</hi> and His Arguments to prove the neceſſity of ſubmitting to Uſurped Powers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His Argument to prove his Notion of a Settlement. His Anſwerer had obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted againſt it,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>That Settlement was a term in Law and imply'd Right,</hi> which he admits in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ettlements according to Law, but in Settlement of Powers againſt Law, it muſt be underſtood of the <hi>Settlement of Poſſeſſion,</hi> and the obvious expoſition of Settlement in <hi>ſuch caſes is a Settlement of Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Very well! This Settlement (ſuch as it is) the <hi>Rumpers</hi> and <hi>Cromwell</hi> had, for they were poſſeſs'd of the Government, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred the Power, and made Laws, and govern'd the People. And we may take the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107829:70"/> Doctor's remark along with us to confirm the point. <hi>It argues great perverſeneſs of mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that ſenſe of the Word which is proper to the Subject to which it is apply'd.</hi> That is, it is very perverſe to ſay, that the Settlements of Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation are any other than the Settlements of Poſſeſſion. And then I doubt it muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be <hi>perverſe</hi> to ſay that the <hi>Rumpers</hi> and <hi>Cromwell</hi> were not <hi>ſetled</hi> Governments. To the ſame purpoſe the Dr. ſays afterwards, <hi>That all the Convocation ſays relates to viſible and actual alterations of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>Now</hi> (ſays he) <hi>this is matter of fact, not of Right: and therefore the ſettlement of ſuch Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations is an</hi> actual <hi>not a legal Settlement of them. And actual and viſible Settlement is all that is requir'd to an actual and viſible tranſlation of Kingdoms.</hi> Is that <hi>all</hi> that is requir'd? Then they had <hi>all</hi> that is requir'd; for their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments were as <hi>actual</hi> and <hi>viſible</hi> as any other: <hi>Cromwell</hi> for ſome years poſſeſs'd the Government, and dy'd in the poſſeſſion of it, and left the poſſeſſion to his ſon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as far as <hi>actual</hi> and <hi>viſible</hi> will go, it is as good a Plea for thoſe Uſurpations as for any other. This is what the Doctor offers in proof to juſtifie his Notion of a <hi>Settlement,</hi> and which in all reſpects <hi>fits Cromwell juſt as if it had been made for him.</hi> And if they are Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſufficient to prove a Settlement, then they likewiſe prove that <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſuch a Settlement.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All the Doctor's Arguments for Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to <hi>Uſurped Powers</hi> equally conclude for Submiſſion whether there be ſuch a conſent of the People or no; as his Doctrine and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Providence, <hi>Then God ſets up Kings,</hi>

He is King who is ſetled in the Throne in the actual adminiſtration of ſovereign Power. That the actual adminiſtration of Authority is the only evidence we have that they have received it from God.</hi> His Argument from Relatives or Relations or what he will pleaſe to call it, that Government and Alleg. are ſuch Relatives or Relations as do <hi>mutuo ſe ponere &amp; tollere.

               <hi>and he has the actual Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity who actually adminiſters the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and it is actual Authority which is Gods Authority.</hi> Now all theſe, if they have any force at all, equally conclude for Submiſſion to all Uſurpers, whether they have or have not the conſent of the People, and that makes no manner of alteration in the Argument; for a <hi>providential</hi> advance to the Throne, and the <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> and <hi>actual adminiſtration</hi> of Power, and the <hi>evidence</hi> of it, and <hi>actual Authority.</hi> theſe are all the ſame whether the People conſent or not. And if the <hi>Rump</hi> and <hi>Cromwel</hi> had not a national conſent, yet they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially advanced to the Throne, and actually adminiſtred the Government; and therefore according to his Arguments they muſt have God's Authority, and therefore ought to have been obey'd. And the ſame is to be ſaid of his Arguments from Scripture, of <hi>Gods removing and ſetting up Kings,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him means no more than remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>from,</hi> and putting <hi>into</hi> the actual adminiſtration of ſovereign Power,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 50.</note> and he tells us from S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that <hi>Reges</hi> are a <hi>Regendo,</hi> and peremptorily aſſerts, <hi>it is certain he who has the exerciſe of the Regal Power and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is King, whether we call him ſo, or no.</hi> Let them be call'd <hi>Rump</hi> or <hi>Protector</hi> or by any other name or names. And ſo likewiſe for his Interpretation of the 13 to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 57.</note> the general Expreſſion <hi>all Powers, The Scriptures giving no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but to ſubmit, and pay all the Obedience of Subjects to the</hi> Preſent <hi>Powers,</hi>

Now all this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning extends to all Uſurpers without any manner of limitation from the conſent of the People, for all thoſe Uſurpers (the <hi>Rump</hi> and <hi>Crom.</hi>) were the <hi>Preſent</hi> Powers, and therefore (according to him) within the intention of that Precept, whether the Nation conſented or no; and the Scripture hath made no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between Uſurpers who have, and Uſurpers who have not the Peoples conſent, And (as he ſays) <hi>Why ſhould we think the Apoſtle here intends a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction unknown in Scripture.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caſe of All. p. 20.</note> The
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:107829:70"/> Doctor to prove his Expoſition argues thus; <hi>When the Apoſtle ſays</hi> All power is of God, <hi>there is no reaſon to confine this to all le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Powers, unleſs it were evidently the Doctrine of Scripture that Uſurped Powers are not of God, which is ſo far from being true, that the contrary is evident.</hi> And this is a reaſon directly againſt all that he ſays here, <hi>When the Apoſtle ſays</hi> All Power is of God, <hi>there is no reaſon to confine this to all Powers</hi> conſented to by the People, <hi>unleſs it were evidently the Doctrine of the Scripture, that Powers without the conſent of the people are not of God, which is ſo far from being true, that the contrary is evident.</hi> And the conſequence is, That this Precept is to be interpreted of all Uſurpers, or of none, and the Dr. muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it of the <hi>Rump</hi> and <hi>Cromwel,</hi> or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his Argument as inſufficient. And let the Dr. at his leiſure ſhew me where in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <hi>All Power</hi> and the <hi>Preſent Powers</hi> and the obedience to them is limited to a national Conſent, or where there is ſuch a diſtinction that the <hi>higher Powers</hi> by the conſent of the People ought to be obey'd, and the higher Powers without their conſent may not; if he will not undertake it, all his Argument from a national conſent ſignifies nothing, if he will he muſt renounce with a witneſs. But the truth is, This buſineſs of the <hi>Peoples Conſent</hi> ſeems to me to be put in for no other end, but to ſtop the mouth of an Objection, which the Dr. foreſaw would open wide upon him, but does not at all concern his <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> which ſtands or falls without any manner of relation to it. For how come the People to have any ſhare in God's Providence in ſetting up Kings? or what have they to do with Gods Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? or how comes it to paſs that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent makes it a duty to obey God's Authority, and their diſſent makes it no duty? Thoſe men indeed that ſay that all Power is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the People, and that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it, and diſpoſe it as they pleaſe, for them to ſay that the conſent of a People ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles a Government or makes it, is agreeable enough to their Principles, and the People derive to the perſons governing the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that is originally in themſelves. But for them that maintain it as a Principle that all ſovereign Authority is of God, to talk of the Peoples conſent as neceſſary to make Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence a duty to that Authority, is a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and it is a fine Doctrine to ſay that the Authority is deriv'd from God, but the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it is deriv'd from the Peoples own conſent. And this it ſeems was the caſe here, for the Dr. tells us with reſpect to thoſe Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, that it was <hi>lawful</hi> to ſubmit to them, tho they were not bound in conſcience to do it. Now if it was lawful for them to ſubmit and become Subjects to thoſe Uſurpations, then they had God's Authority; for it is not <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to become Subjects to perſons who have not God's Authority, if they were not bound in Conſcience, then their obedience to God's Authority depended purely upon their own conſent: And that is, God by his Providence gives the Uſurpers Authority, and the People by their Conſent make it a duty to obey it. And ſo the matter is divided; the Authority of Government is from God, and the duty of the People from themſelves. If the Dr. hath a mind to deliver his preſent Argument from theſe conſequences, let him give ſome other account of the Peoples conſent, and I am afraid it muſt come to one of theſe two, either that Uſurpers have not God's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or if they have, then the Peoples conſent is not neceſſary to make obedience a duty: if the firſt, then his Hypotheſis, and moſt part of his two books, ſignifie nothing; if the laſt, then all that he ſays on the preſent head ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies as little.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe Uſurpations might be ſetled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctor's Notion of a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, notwithſtanding what he hath oppos'd to the contrary. Now it will be needleſs to repeat the Doctor's Notion of a Settlement at length. He does not think convenient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon it himſelf. He takes ſanctuary only in one ſmall branch of it, <hi>The ſubmiſſion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the great Body of the Nation.</hi> And me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks ſince the Dr. inſiſts ſo much upon it, he ſhould have given us ſome ſmall proof, or if that could not be had, ſomething like a proof, that the <hi>Peoples Conſent</hi> is included in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Settlement,</hi> or that a <hi>ſetled Government</hi> to which God annexes his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by plain conſtruction means the Peoples conſent All the reſt of the Branches (for this ſame thorough Settlement according to him is a great compoſition) viz. <hi>The whole adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government,</hi>

But this of the <hi>Peoples Conſent</hi> muſt ſhift for it ſelf; if it will ſerve to anſwer an Objection well and good, but for proving it no matter for that, tho it ſeems, (as the Dr. now ſtates the matter) it is not one branch but the chief, nay for any thing I can ſee it is all the Settlement, or however it is ſo eſſential to it, that all the reſt are nothing wi hout it, <hi>Poſſeſſion of the Throne by providence, T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. By Acts virtually declaring it: When he was proclaimed <hi>Protector,</hi> there were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Acclamations, and ſuch other Expreſſions as are uſual upon the proclaiming a new King, and after that more expreſs Acknowledgments: he was publickly and ſolemnly treated by the City under the Character of Supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and in that Character own'd and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to by the moſt, if not by the whole of the Nation; ſo that if the Conſent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be virtually declar'd he certainly had it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He had a formal and expreſs Conſent ſo far as Repreſentatives <hi>illegally</hi> choſen could make ſuch a conſent. He ſummon'd two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, both of them met upon his Writ; both of them own'd his Authority, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly recogniz'd it. But to this the Dr. hath ſome Objections.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Parliament ſummon'd according to the directions of the Inſtrument</hi> (of Government agreed on by <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his Officers) <hi>never could make a National Conſent.</hi> And I pray mark his Reaſons, for they are two; 1. <hi>For they were not choſen according to the ancient Uſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Cuſtoms of the Nation,</hi> a very weighty Reaſon according to the Doctor's Principles, for neither is an Uſurper a King according to the <hi>ancient Uſages and Cuſtoms of the Nation.</hi> And if the Conſent of the People by their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives cannot be made but by the <hi>anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uſtoms and Uſages of the Nation,</hi> then a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament call'd by an Uſurper can make no ſuch Conſent. This Reaſon I ſuppoſe came from him unawares.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His ſecond Reaſon is, <hi>Nor were they the Repreſentatives of the Nation, but only of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Party and Faction;</hi> and his reaſon of that is, <hi>for that Artic.</hi> 14. (of the Inſtrument) <hi>'tis provided no perſons aiding, adviſing, aſſiſting, or abetting in the War againſt the Parliament ſince</hi> 41. <hi>unleſs they had been ſince in the Parliaments Service, and given ſignal Teſtimonies of their good affections, ſhould give any Vote in the Election of Members.</hi> And what proportion did theſe bear to the whole Nation? Moſt of thoſe that had been active in the Kings Service were fled, ſeveral turn'd to the Government and were within the Qualification; and how many were the reſt? certainly very few in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the whole. So that notwithſtanding ſuch reſtriction, thoſe that were elected might repreſent the <hi>great Body</hi> of the Nation, which is all the Dr. requires to ſuch a Conſent. But here the Dr. objects again, <hi>That after ſuch Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they were not Parliament men, unleſs they were approved to be Perſons not diſabled by the major part of the Council;</hi> and accordingly he tells us, that many perſons who were return'd in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Parliament were not approved, which occaſion'd a Remonſtrance ſubſcribed
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107829:71"/> by near a hundred. And what then? One Parliament I hope, is ſufficient to give the peoples conſent. The people in two years time (the diſtance between the two Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) might grow weary of the Uſurpation, and ſend up Members of another temper; but what did that ſignifie to their choice before? were any of the firſt Parliament ſecluded upon that account? That the Dr. does not ſay; but for that he tells us, <hi>The firſt Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be very buſie about the New Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (but in what particulars he does not ſay) <hi>but the Protector ſent for them into the Painted Chamber, and taught them better.</hi> Well! then they <hi>were better taught,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with him. And he before their next ſitting, appointed a New Teſt; and one branch of it was (as the Dr. repeats it) <hi>I do hereby freely promiſe and engage my ſelf to be true and faithful to the Lord Protector.</hi> And he tells that day one hundred and thirty Members took it, and for ought appears to the contrary, all the reſt took it afterwards. And is not this a pure argument, that they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his Government? I ſuppoſe becauſe they took an Oath to be <hi>true and faithful</hi> to him. And ſo the Dr. hath fairly prov'd his point.</p>
            <p>Well! however that be, it can never be deny'd, no not by the Doctor himſelf, but that a very great number did expreſly conſent? And what became of them? Why truly, according to him, they became Subjects; for it was <hi>lawful</hi> to ſubmit: and when they had ſubmitted, it became a duty to <hi>them,</hi> tho the reſt were free. So that all they that took the <hi>Engagement,</hi> were Subjects to the <hi>Rumpers;</hi> and all that took the Oath to <hi>Oliver,</hi> of otherwiſe expreſly conſented to his Government, were his Subjects, and the reſt were Subjects to King <hi>Charles,</hi> or rather to no body, but were in intereſt engag'd to him. And what a ſpecial Society have we got here? one part of the ſame Society are Subjects to one perſon, another part to another, or rather, abſolutely free: one Party are oblig'd in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and by their Oaths, to ſupport one Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment with their Lives and Fortunes the other Party are oblig'd by Intereſt (a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple found by experience, to be much ſtronger than Oaths or Conſcience) to pull it down, and to ſet up another; and according to their differing obligations, they were bound to cut one anothers Throats at the firſt opportunity. Now the Dr. may call this a Humane Society if he pleaſe; but it ſuits better by half with a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Wolves and Tygres. The Dr. has forgot,<note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg. p. 38, 39.</note> that one of his principal Aruments for Submiſſion to Uſurpers, <hi>is the neceſſity of Government to preſerve Humane Societies; for Humane Societies muſt not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve into a <hi>Mob,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>'s State of Nature.</hi> And yet it ſeems to anſwer an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, it muſt diſſolve into ſomething very like them. To ſerve that purpoſe, the Dr. <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> that <hi>no man who conſiders it well, will call that a Civil Government, or a Civil Society, to which Authority and Obedience is Eſſential.</hi> But to ſerve another purpoſe, All Authority and Obedience is ſtated quite away, and they may ſubmit, or not ſubmit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, <hi>i. e.</hi> there is a Society, <hi>where is neither King, nor Subject, no Authority to command, nor Duty to obey.</hi> When the Dr. is to prove ſubmiſſion to Uſurpers, from the neceſſities of Government to preſerve Humane Societies; why then, <hi>if God will preſerve Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society, we muſt conclude, that when he removes one King out of the Throne, he gives his Authority to him whom he places there, for without Authority, Humane Societies muſt disband; Power may tye men together a while, but can never unite them into a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Body, without the Bonds and Ligaments of Duty and Conſcience.</hi> But when the Dr. is for <hi>vindicating</hi> his Arguments from laying any Reproach on the Loyal Sufferers, <hi>then he ſtates the matter ſo plain, as no body can miſtake or miſrepreſent it:</hi> and that is, that we muſt <hi>conclude</hi> no ſuch thing at all; we muſt not <hi>conclude,</hi> that God has given his Authority to him that is placed on the Throne, and the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of Government for preſervation of Humane Society, do not give Authority to him that governs, and lay an obligation of duty on the Subject,</hi> and Societies muſt hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as well as they can. For <hi>there are no Bonds and Ligaments of Duty and Conſcience.</hi> For he tells us very expreſly, <hi>that the Subjects were not in thoſe days bound <hi>in Conſcience</hi> to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vind. p. 66.</note>

               <hi>to thoſe uſurped powers,</hi> who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>actually govern'd,</hi> and exercis'd the whole <hi>adminiſtration</hi> of Government for ſome years. Well! I perceive ſome Objections will not be anſwer'd, except a man contradicts himſelf; but they muſt be anſwer'd, however.</p>
            <p>The Dr. goes on to tell us, that ſince <hi>here was no ſuch ſettlement as would oblige the Subjects in conſcience to obey and ſubmit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vind. p. 70.</note> 
               <hi>he ſhewed there were other very great reaſons why they ſhould not ſubmit.</hi> And <hi>this,</hi> he ſayes, <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers all my little objections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now we are once again to remember, that the Dr. quarrels with me, for <hi>altering his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Method;</hi> and tells me, <hi>there is more of art than honeſty in it:</hi> And here again he has done it himſelf. For all that is ſaid before on this Head, was urg'd by him in the laſt place, and accordingly in the ſame order an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd: and in his <hi>Vindication</hi> he hath begun with it, and inverted his own order; and 'tis plain Artifice, to diſguiſe the weakneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of thoſe other matters he then urg'd; for had he reply'd to them in the ſame order, every Reader might have perceiv'd it. The Objection (which he calls a prejudice) which he laid down,<note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg. p. 45, 46.</note> and which he was to anſwer, was, That his Hypotheſis <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſerv'd all Revolutions, Rump, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> &amp;c. and yet <hi>under that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation, the Loyal Party thought themſelves bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to oppoſe it at their utmoſt peril: And ſhall we arraign them all as reſiſting God's Ordinance?</hi> His Anſwer is, <hi>There is a great difference between the two caſes;</hi> and he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to <hi>ſhew it upon many accounts:</hi> and adds, <hi>And all together will be more than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer enough.</hi> My Anſwer was, <q>Thoſe were no differences as to the matter before us of Submiſſion to Uſurped Powers.<note place="margin">Poſtſcr. p. 14.</note>
               </q> And what does he reply to this, with reſpect to thoſe many differences he reckons up? not one ſingle word; but reſolves all his Anſwers into the former Reply. For inſtance, he had urg'd as one great difference, <hi>The great Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of thoſe days, open and bare-fac'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, the murder of one of the beſt Princes.</hi> I anſwer'd, <hi>the Dr. maintains, that ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is due to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Powers, by what ill means ſoever they attain'd it; that therefore makes no difference in his argument.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes, <hi>What not to prejudice wiſe and good men againſt all compliances?</hi> He ſhould have added what he ſays in his Caſe of Allegiance, <hi>though they had been lawful;</hi> and that would have ſhewn the unreaſonableneſs of urging prejudices, for the practice of wiſe and good men, againſt what had been <hi>lawful.</hi> He adds, <hi>for who that could poſſibly avoid it;</hi> and to explain this, he tells us in a Parentheſis <hi>(that is where ſtrict duty does not oblige, nor irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable force conſtrain) would ſubmit to ſuch men: i. e.</hi> The former Reply of <hi>not being bound in conſcience,</hi> becauſe that Government was not ſet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This he intimates by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply;<note place="margin">P. 47.</note> and then I would deſire him to explain what he means, when he ſays in his <hi>Caſe of Allegiance, they had no way to keep their Livings, eſpecially if they were of any value, but by renouncing the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as well as by ſubmiſſion to that Government, which</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I believe notwithſtanding their ready complyance in taking the Oaths, the Clergy at this day,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:107829:72"/> would more univerſally have refuſed, than they did then.</hi> What if it be a duty to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and take the Oaths? Does Allegiance to the Civil Government ceaſe to be a duty, if they overturn the Church? This will reflect upon St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine, and the practice of the Primitive Chriſtians, under the Heathen Emperours. And I doubt I had very good reaſon to make this Anſwer, <q>I hope the being diſabled to keep a Living, eſpecially if it be a good one, is not a ſufficient Reaſon to rebel.</q> The Dr. is pleaſant in his Reply, and tells me, <hi>he would deſire me carefully to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, for it did not concern them.</hi> Very well! but it concerns him, or elſe his reaſon above, is very ridiculous: for if men may refuſe to ſubmit, when it is a duty, becauſe they cannot hold a good Living according to the Conſtitutions of the Church: Then I doubt it follows, that Civil Duty is to be meaſur'd, not by a <hi>Thorough Settlement,</hi> but by <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Preferments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another difference the Dr. mention'd, was, <hi>The whole Government in Church and State was overturn'd, which was the Fundamental Conſtitution of the Nation.</hi> I anſwer'd, <q>This was but changing the Form of Government; and the <hi>Convocation</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Degenerate Forms of Government;</hi> and Uſurped Powers are not to be limited to a King, but to a Government; and the uſurping upon the Lords and Commons, as well as upon the King, is but Uſurpation ſtill.</q> He replyes, <hi>I grant it, but when ſuch degenerate Forms are not thoroughly ſettled, the ſubverſion of the Fundamental Conſtitution, is a reaſonable prejudice againſt ſubmiſſion, when it is not a duty.</hi>

               </gap>me An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer over and over. In his <hi>Caſe of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,</hi> he mentions a great many differences; and I had ſuited my Anſwers to them, and ſhew'd they made no difference in the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and when he comes to <hi>reply,</hi> he gives one Reply to them all. And that is, that all his differences are come to one ſingle diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; and the Queſtion at laſt is come into a narrow compaſs; and with reſpect to the duty of Submiſſion to Uſurped Powers, the Queſtion is not, whether they attain the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation by Villanies, or by barbarous uſage of honeſt and loyal people, or by encroachments on the Church, and the perſecution of its members, or by overturning the Legal Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; but the ſingle Queſtion is, whether the Government be ſettled, and all the reſt ſignifie nothing to the Argument. And this I had told him, <hi>if he would prove the Government of thoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations was not ſettled,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Poſtſcr. p. 15.</note> 
               <hi>he might let all the reſt alone.</hi> And which he hath now done in his Reply, tho he would not ſeem to do it: ſo that my Objections, as <hi>little</hi> as they are, have oblig'd him to quit theſe differences, as making no difference in the Argument, which he cannot deny, tho he cannot endure to own it. For what difference did the <hi>villanies of thoſe days,</hi> make in the Argument? Why truly, it <hi>prejudic'd wiſe and good men</hi> (as all <hi>villanies</hi> do one as well as another) and <hi>where no ſtrict duty ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd, who would ſubmit?</hi> That is, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Argument lyes not in the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, but in not being a <hi>ſtrict duty.</hi> What difference did the <hi>Barbarous uſage of the Kings friends,</hi> make in the Argument? Why, it <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated an averſion</hi> (as Hanging, and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſuch like kindneſſes are apt to do) and <hi>was a reaſon not to ſubmit, when they were not oblig'd in conſcience; i. e.</hi> the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Argument, lyes in the not being <hi>oblig'd in conſcience,</hi> and not in the <hi>averſion.</hi> What difference did the <hi>overturning the Church, and the being diſabled to keep a good Living,</hi> make in the Argument? Why, <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever loves the Church</hi> (and a good Living) <hi>will not chooſe to ſubmit, when not oblig'd in conſcience.</hi> So that had <hi>Cromwell</hi> reſtor'd <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> and the <hi>Church Lands,</hi> all would have been well, and he might have had a <hi>Caſe of Allegiance due to Sovereign Princes</hi> wrote in juſtification of ſubmiſſion to him. What difference did the <hi>overturning the Conſtitution</hi> make in the Argument? Why, it is a <hi>reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable prejudice</hi> (as the peoples making whom they pleaſe King in an Hereditary Monarchy may be) <hi>againſt ſubmiſſion when the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not thoroughly ſettled, and when it is not a duty: i. e.</hi> the difference in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument lyes in the Government <hi>not being ſettled,</hi> and not in the <hi>prejudice.</hi> It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore evident enough, that all thoſe make no
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107829:73"/> difference in the Argument; and if the Dr. had reply'd in the ſame order, with his own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and my Anſwer, every body would have perceiv'd it; but inſtead of that, he is for <hi>new ſtating the matter.</hi> And the Reaſon of their non-complyance, is to be reſolv'd into nothing but prejudice and intereſt; altho he himſelf had put it into the Objection. <hi>They thought themſelves bound <hi>in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to oppoſe that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation at their utmoſt peril:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg. p. 46. &amp; 48.</note> and at the end of his Anſwer expreſſes it, <hi>thoſe who thought it their duty never to ſubmit to that wicked <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am now come to my Parting Objection in the <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> of which the Dr. gives us this fair account,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 71.</note> That <hi>it is ſo very ridiculous, that had he begun with it, I ſhould have thought he had only intended it for a Jeſt; but I am now ſo well acquainted with his way of reaſoning, that I am ſatisfied he is capable of thinking it an Argument.</hi> Upon my Word, this is very big; and a man would imagine, there was ſomething very wretched and trifling in the Argument. But I am ſo well acquainted with his way of replying, that I am confident here is ſomething he cannot anſwer, and therefore it is to be run down with ſcorn and contempt. If Arguments will not be anſwer'd, let them be hooted at; and perhaps with ſome Readers, that may do as well: and tho I do not believe, that the Dr. is capable of thinking, that ſuch things are Anſwers; yet I do not know, but he may be capable of thinking, that ſome people may take lofty and ſcornful words, for good and plain Anſwers. Well! let us ſee how <hi>ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> the Drs. Anſwer makes it.</p>
            <p>The Argument is this, <q>If poſſeſſion of Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er contrary to Law,<note place="margin">Poſtſcript, p. 15.</note> be Gods Authority, and ought to be obey'd, then whatſoever Sovereign Power a Prince poſſeſſes himſelf of, is likewiſe God's Authority, &amp; ought to be obey'd.</q> He anſwers, <hi>But where do I ſay, that poſſeſſion of Sovereign Power contrary to Law, is God's Authority?</hi> A pleaſant Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Where did he not ſay it? It is but all over his Book: What is Uſurpation, but poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of power <hi>contrary to Law?</hi> And if the Dr. hath any other definition of it, he would do well to produce it. But for a man who writes a Book, to juſtifie ſubmiſſion to <hi>Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Powers,</hi> as having <hi>God's Authority,</hi> to ask me, where he ſaid, <hi>that poſſeſſion of Sovereign Power contrary to Law, is God's Authority,</hi> is a <hi>Jeſt</hi> indeed. But here the Dr. is very angry, as if I had done him ſome wrong, and tells me, <hi>I do not pretend that he ſaid it in expreſs words, but this I ſuppoſe is the ſenſe of what he ſays:</hi> and adds, <hi>But I deſire he would keep to my words, for I will anſwer for none of his ſenſes, unleſs I were better ſatisfied both of his underſtanding and honeſty.</hi> Now I do not deſire the Dr. ſhould anſwer for any of my ſenſes, unleſs he could anſwer a little better for his own. Let him but anſwer for his own, and I will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; but he will not do that. And I muſt tell him, that <hi>denying</hi> his ſenſe, is not anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for it. For for all his impertinent Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domontade, that which I have ſaid, is his ſenſe, or elſe his Book is not his ſenſe: for what does he mean by <hi>Illegal Powers,</hi> but <hi>powers contrary to Law?</hi> And (which is the <hi>Cream of the Jeſt</hi>) he immediately adds, <hi>I ſay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that a Prince who is ſettled in the poſſeſſion of Sovereign Power, tho he have no Legal Title to the Crown, has God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; i. e.</hi> he ſays the ſame thing, that he makes ſuch a terrible ſwaggering at me for ſaying: for ſays he, <hi>and what then? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Poſſeſſion of Sovereign Power contrary to Law, is God's Authority, how does this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low?</hi> And how does it otherwiſe then follow? For what I pray is <hi>a Prince not having a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Title,</hi> but a Prince <hi>contrary to Law?</hi> and what is ſuch a Princes <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of Sovereign Power, but the <hi>poſſeſſion of it contrary to Law?</hi> And if he hath God's Authority by vertue of his poſſeſſion of Sovereign Power contrary to Law, then it follows that poſſeſſion of Sovereign Power contrary to Law, is God's Authority. And does not he tell us,<note place="margin">Vind. p. 46.</note> 
               <hi>That the Authority of Government, is always God's Authority:</hi> And what does he mean by Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but the Poſſeſſion of Sovereign Power? And what hath he to ſay to this? He adds, <hi>Cannot God ſettle a King upon the Throne, without a Legal Title, but he muſt be
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107829:73"/> preſumed to give him Authority, whenever he has power, to govern by an arbitrary will, againſt the Laws of the Land? Cannot God make a King, without giving him Authority to do all that he has power to do?</hi> Now the Dr. has the beſt faculty of turning his Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ever I ſaw, when he is to prove, that God gives his Authority to Illegal and Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped powers; then the Queſtion is, <hi>Cannot God make a King without a Legal Title? Is God confin'd to Humane Laws in making Kings?</hi> And when he is to prove, that theſe Uſurpers are to govern according to Law, then he is for asking, <hi>Cannot God ſet up a King, without a Legal Title, but he muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd to give him Authority to govern againſt the Laws of the Land?</hi> No doubt but God can do both; but that is not the Queſtion. And if we muſt anſwer by Queſtions, his Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion plainly turns upon him, Cannot God make a King, without confining him to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern by the Laws of the Land, as well as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Legal Title? No doubt he can do that if he pleaſe. And this brings us to the merits of the Cauſe, which the Dr. would fain ſhift off. And the Queſtion is, if a Prince in a Limited Monarchy, poſſeſſes himſelf of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Sovereign Power, and actually admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters it contrary to Law, whether according to his Principles he hath not God's Authority, and ought to be obey'd, and we have not the ſame Evidence that he hath it that we have, that Uſurped Powers have God's Authority. And that is <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> and <hi>Providence:</hi> and if we muſt preſume, that God gives his Authority to an Uſurper, who is in poſſeſſion of Sovereign Power contrary to Law, I would fain ſee a Reaſon why we muſt not preſume, that God gives his Authority to a Prince, who poſſeſſes and exerciſes Arbitrary Sovereign Power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law? And if the Law muſt be our Rule, againſt the poſſeſſion of Arbitrary Power, why is it not alſo our Rule, againſt Uſurped Powers? The one is as conſiſtent with Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power, as the other: The one God may give as well as the other; &amp; the Evidence that God does ſo, is the ſame in both. The one is as contrary to the Law as the other; and the denyal of it, as much confines God to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws as the other. And here my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment plainly affects him, which he takes no manner of notice of; <q>The aſſuming an <hi>Illegal</hi> Power,<note place="margin">Poſtſcript, p. 16.</note> is no more againſt the Laws, than <hi>Illegal</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped</hi> Powers: And God, when he gives Authority, is confin'd to our Laws and Conſtitutions, no more in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Power, than in the Perſon; and the only Evidence that we have that God gives it, is the poſſeſſion of it by Providence; and whatſoever Power a Prince is poſſeſs'd of, hath the ſame Evidence; and conſequently is a branch of the ſame Authority. And <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power</hi> is not inconſiſtent with the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Sovereign Power,</hi> and whatever limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Government there are now in the World, they are only limitations made by Humane Laws, and of no force againſt God's Authority.</q> But this it ſeems was ſo <hi>very ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,</hi> that the Dr. had not one ſingle word to ſay to it. And I muſt tell him, that I am not only <hi>capable</hi> of thinking it an argument againſt him, but I am <hi>capable of</hi> thinking it ſuch an argument as he cannot anſwer, without quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome of his Principles. And becauſe he deſpiſes it ſo much, I do here provoke him to it. And in the mean time, 'tis <hi>very ridiculous,</hi> to ſcorn an argument; and when he comes to anſwer it, to leave out the whole ſtrength and force of it.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon I added to confirm my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was, <q>For the formal Reaſon of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſuch a Prince, is, becauſe he hath God's Authority; and the Evidence that he hath that Authority, is, becauſe he is poſſeſſed of Sovereign Power.</q> He anſwers, <q>
                  <hi>Suppoſe this, tho God's Authority be the formal reaſon of our obedience to a Prince, yet it is not the Rule of our obedience.</hi>
               </q> Very well! Then the <hi>Law</hi> is our Rule: and why I pray, is not the <hi>Law</hi> our Rule, with reſpect to the Perſon, as well as with reſpect to the duty we owe him. The Law directs to the Perſon, as well as to the duty, and directs the duty <hi>only</hi> to that Perſon: By the Law a Prince ought not to have <hi>Arbitrary Power;</hi> and by the ſame Law, an Uſurper ought to have no power at all. If therefore the <hi>Law</hi> be our Rule, for the ſame reaſon that we ought not to obey the acts of <hi>Illegal Power,</hi> we ought not to obey <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Powers</hi> at all.<note place="margin">Vindic p. 72.</note> But the Dr tells us, <hi>The Authority of God, is
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107829:74"/> only an authority to govern according to the Laws of God and Nature, or the Laws of the Land.</hi> Now the Doctor knows well enough, that in this Argument I oppoſe <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Sovereign Power, not to the Laws of God and Nature, but to the Laws of the Land, even in the ſame ſenſe the Dr. under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Powers;</hi> and if poſſeſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law, gives Authority to Uſurpation, why not to Arbitrary Power? But that I doubt, is a <hi>Ridiculous</hi> Queſtion too: for men do not love to be ask'd more Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than they can anſwer. He adds, <hi>Tho Sovereign Princes may have ſuch an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as muſt not be reſiſted, yet in a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Monarchy, they have no more Authority from God to tranſgreſs the Laws of the Land, than in an Abſolute Monarchy, to tranſgreſs the Laws of God and Nature.</hi> The Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion couch'd in theſe words, is this, <hi>That in a Limited Monarchy, a Power that tranſgreſſeth the Laws of the Land, is not God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> And then farewel to Uſurpation, that has not God's Authority: For the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Uſurped Powers, is a fundamental tranſgreſſion of the Laws of the Land. And if men have no Authority from G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the Laws of the Land, then an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hath no Authority at all. Arbitrary Power tranſgreſſeth the Laws of the Land, and therefore it is not God's Authority; and Uſurpation tranſgreſſeth it ten times more: and therefore, if the Reaſon be good, that alſo is not God's Authority. He goes on, <hi>indeed Arbitrary Government is not the poſſeſſion of Sovereign Power, which is God's Authority, but the Arbitrary Exerciſe of it.</hi> What does he mean by this? Is not Arbitrary Power God's Authority in an Abſolute Monarchy, as well as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited power in a Limited Monarchy? If he means this, he ought to have prov'd it; and he may yet prove it, if he thinks it will help his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis. But <hi>it is the Arbitrary Exerciſe of it:</hi> Of what, of <hi>God's Authority,</hi> or of <hi>Sovereign Power?</hi> If Arbitrary Government, be the Arbtrary Exerciſe of God's Authority, then it ought to be obey'd; for God's Authority ought to be obey'd, in what manner ſoever it is exercis'd. It or Sovereign Power, then I deſire to know, why the <hi>Arbitrary Exerciſe</hi> of Sovereign Power, is not the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Arbitrary So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power,</hi> as well as the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of a Limited Power, is the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of that Power. The Dr. tells us over and over, of the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful efficacy of <hi>Actual Government, Actual Authority, Actual Adminiſtration,</hi> which are but other words for the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of it; and which are the only Evidences that God gives it, and 'tis that whereby God inveſts them with it. And why is not the <hi>Actual Exerciſe of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power,</hi> or the Arbitrary Exerciſe of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power (for I know no difference) as well the Evidence that God gives it, and ſigns of his inveſting them with Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as Actual Government, and Actual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration is an evidence, that God gives to them that Government they actually admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Arbitrary Government, not confin'd by Humane Laws, is one kind of Government, and a Government limited by Humane Laws, is another kind; and why is not actual admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, an equal Evidence, that God gives one, as well as the other, that he makes a Legal King an Abſolute Monarch, as well as that he makes a Perſon who hath no Right, a Sovereign Prince? He that uſurps upon the Rights of his people, is no more an Uſurper, and generally much leſs, than he that uſurps upon the Rights of the Prince: The Drs. main Principle of Providence, and his main Arguments to prove it make no difference. And it is a little my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, and muſt ſo remain, till the Dr. explains it, why the very ſame Reaſons will not make it a duty to ſubmit to Arbitrary Power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws of the Land, as well as to ſubmit to Uſurped Powers contrary to the ſame Laws. He adds, <hi>And tho we muſt obey God's Authority, it does not hence follow, that we muſt obey the exerciſe of Arbitrary Power.</hi> Now I wiſh he had given us a reaſon for this, and then we ſhould have ſeen the force of his Anſwer. I confeſs, becauſe <hi>we muſt obey God's Authority, it does not follow, that we muſt obey the Exerciſe of Arbitrary Power:</hi> And what is the Reaſon? Becauſe the Exerciſe of Arbitrary Power in a Limited Monarchy is contrary to the Laws of the Land, and ſo is Uſurpation too: and if that be a good reaſon againſt our obedience to Arbitrary Power, 'tis as good a Reaſon againſt our obedience to Uſurpers</p>
            <p>He goes on, <hi>And yet I do not attribute God's Authority (which we muſt obey in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience) to the bare poſſeſſion of Power,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107829:74"/> but to the ſettled poſſeſſion of it, that is, with the conſent and ſubmiſſion of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and could a Prince change a Limited into an Abſolute Monarchy by a National Conſent, Subjects were then as much bound in conſcience to ſubmit to an Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power, as they are now to obey the Laws, but then this would not be an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority againſt Law, but the Law would be changed.</hi> And this I had ſaid before, and draw'd an Inference from it: <q>That an Illegal Power is not throughly ſettled,<note place="margin">Poſtſcript, p. 17.</note> nor does bind the Subject to obedience, 'till it becomes Legal; for a National Conſent may part with the Rights of a Nation, as well as the conſent of a Prince may part with his own Rights.</q> But this was very ridiculous too: for the Dr. did not think fit to take notice of it, tho it plainly confutes his notion of the <hi>Peoples Conſent.</hi> The people may paſs away their own Rights; but what have they to do with the Government, and to give away the Rights of that? And why may not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Prince, part with the Rights of his People; as well as the Conſent of the People, part with the Right of the Prince? And a man may as well ſay, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of one man, may give away the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of another, as to ſay, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the People, may diſpoſe of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Rights of a Prince againſt his own Conſent. And here is the plain diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the Conſent of the People to Arbitrary Power, makes that a Legal Government, and there is no wrong done; but the Conſent of the People to Uſurpation, violates the Rights of the Legal Prince, and defrauds him of what by Law is his due.</p>
            <p>He proceeds, <hi>But do not I ſay, that when the Laws of the Land contradict the Laws of God, they are no Rule to us, but their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt give place to Divine Authority.</hi> He ſhould (ſays he) have cited the whole, <hi>That the Laws of the Land are the Rule of Conſcience, when they do not contradict the Laws of God; but when they do, they are no Rule to us; So that the Laws of the Land muſt be the Rule of our obedience to Princes, unleſs they contradict the Laws of God, and I do not know that any of our Laws do that,</hi> Say you ſo? then the Laws of Succeſſion muſt be the Rule of our obedience; and we muſt obey none but the Legal King. And he muſt find out a new notion of Contradiction, before he can prove, that the Laws of Succeſſion in an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Monarchy, contradict the Laws of God.</p>
            <p>He adds, <hi>It is a certain truth, as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor muſt confeſs, that if the Laws of the Land contradict the Laws of God, they are no Rule to us: But this proves nothing in particular, without proving the Laws of the Land are contrary to the Laws of God. If then he can prove, that by the Law of God we are bound to obey the Arbitrary Will of the Prince againſt the Laws of the Land whenever he will command things againſt Law, and has power to cruſh us, if we will not obey, I will readily grant, and ſo muſt he, that it is our duty to do it; but 'till he prove this, he muſt not take it for granted, there is ſuch a Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here we have a ſtrain of the Drs admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Ingenuity. An unwary Reader may be apt from hence to conclude, that the Deſign of my Argument <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re, had been to prove, that it was a duty to obey Arbitrary Power againſt the Laws of the Land; whereas it is the clean contrary, and proceeds upon the ſuppoſition, that it is not a duty: and from thence I ſhew the abſurdity of the Drs. Principles and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which equally conclude for ſubmiſſion to Arbitrary Power, as to Uſurpation. And yet by a fine piece of dexterity the Dr. would thruſt the abſurdities of his own Doctrines upon me, and by a ſhameleſs inſinuation make me appear to argue for obedience to Arbitrary Power, when I only argue from his Principles, and from thence ſhew the inconſequence and abſurdity of his Arguments. For thus it follows in the Dr. <hi>What he means by this argument,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vind p 73.</note> 
               <hi>I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell; if he does think there is ſuch a Law of God, I ſuppoſe he intended in <hi>good earneſt</hi> to prove, that we muſt ſubmit to the Arbitrary Will of the Prince, and to condemn the oppoſition that was made in the late Reign to ſuch arbitrary proceedings, if he did not believe there was any ſuch Law of God, how ridiculous was it to pretend that <hi>we muſt</hi> ſubmit to Arbitrary Will and Power againſt Law, becauſe when the Laws of the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107829:75"/> Land contradict the Laws of God, they are no Rule to us.</hi> Now what kind of interpretation of the Convocation are we to expect from him, who deals thus with his Adverſaries? If contrary to all Juſtice he can turn the ſenſe the clean contrary, to expoſe an argument, which he cannot anſwer, what wonder is it, if he wreſts the Convocation to ſerve his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis. Does he act at this rate, and yet talk of the <hi>honeſty</hi> of his adverſary? Let him ſhew where I have play'd ſuch egregious tricks with any of his arguments, and I will bear the infamy, and ask his pardon to boot; but if he cannot, it returns double upon him, both in making a falſe charge, and condemning his adverſary for that, of which himſelf is only guilty.</p>
            <p>For a concluſion of this Point, I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow another <hi>Jeſt</hi> upon the Dr. (which alſo <hi>I am capable of thinking an Argument</hi>) and it is rais'd from his New Hypotheſis of <hi>force,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 13, 14.</note> which be tells us, <hi>will juſtifie ſubmiſſion from what quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſoever it comes,</hi> that <hi>force</hi> juſtified the <hi>Jews</hi> acting contrary to <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oſitive Laws of God, which they were religiouſly bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, by vertue of their Covenant with him, and which was as ſacred as any Oath, and that it will juſtifie the Subjects of Humane Governments, whatever their Oaths, or obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations be, to ſubmit to a new and greater force.</hi> Now from hence, I <hi>jeſt</hi> or argue (which the Dr. pleaſe) with reſpect to the <hi>Caſes</hi> of <hi>Reading the Declaration,</hi> and of the Gentlemen of <hi>Magdalen Colledge</hi> (the very inſtances I had urg'd againſt him) and the very words with a little variation will form it:<note place="margin">Poſtſcript, p. 16.</note> 
               <q>We thought the Laws were our Rule, and they, their Statutes, and ſo it ſeems they were, <hi>if there were no greater force to diſſolve the obligation.</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>Now I ſuppoſe, no body at that time diſputed K. <hi>J's</hi> power, <hi>or force,</hi> if he had only commanded them to chooſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Preſident contrary to their Statutes and their Oaths, and had not been able to <hi>cruſh</hi> them if they refus'd, then the Statutes were their Rules, <hi>and their Oaths bound them,</hi> and they were oblig'd in Conſcience to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them. But if he were able to <hi>cruſh</hi> them (as what he actually did, he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly able to do) <hi>then all their obligations ceas'd,</hi> and they might have obey'd his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand contrary to their Statutes and their Oaths, <hi>by vertue of the power and force he had in his hands to cruſh them and undo them.</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>Now here is the ſingle Queſtion, Had the Gentlemen of <hi>Magdalen Colledge</hi> comply'd with the Will and Power of the King contrary to their Statutes and Oaths, had they in ſo doing, been perjur'd?</q> If they had, <hi>then Laws and Oaths bind againſt force,</hi> and men are bound to ſtand by them, let the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be never ſo able to cruſh them for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal. And if <hi>that</hi> force, and ten times more, would not have excus'd them from perjury, had they comply'd; I wonder how it ſhould do it, in the greater and more publick inſtances. For, how comes an Oath to Local Statutes, to be of more force, than an Oath of Allegiance? or (as the Doctor ſpeaks in the inſtance of the <hi>Jews</hi>) than God's Covenant with his people? Or how the Statutes of a <hi>Colledge,</hi> ſhould be more obligatory, than the Laws of a Nation. Now we muſt remember that this was the Caſe of <hi>private Subjects,</hi> and of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Colledge, upon the account of which, the Dr. ſayes, <hi>Force will juſtifie ſubmiſſion, and then it is much the ſame thing from what quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the force comes, when a man is under the power of a new Government, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſiſt, which will not protect him; nay, which will undo, and ruine him, if he will not ſubmit, 'tis all one,</hi> &amp;c. Now I only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know, why force coming from the <hi>quarter</hi> of the <hi>Legal</hi> King, will not juſtifie ſubmiſſion contrary to Laws and Oaths, as well as force coming from any other <hi>quarter.</hi> And if he in any caſe, will ruine and undo a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Subject if he refuſes, why that will not juſtifie his actions contrary to the Laws, and his Oaths, as well as the ſame coming from an Uſurper. And if this be the caſe, Laws and Oaths may ſerve to talk on, but in truth are of very little uſe, and tend to very little purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Dr. ſays, <hi>He ſhall only add, That when the Convocation ſpeaks of a ſettlement,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 73.</note> 
               <hi>they mean the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of a Government with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſelf, and not with reſpect to foreign force and power: for ſo they expreſs it,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:107829:76"/> 
                  <hi>when they have eſtabliſh'd any of the ſaid degenerate forms of Government amongſt their own people,</hi> and then the Government may be throughly ſettled within it ſelf, before it have a peaceable poſſeſſion and ſettlement.</hi> The Dr. it ſeems was ſenſible, that he had not ſaid one word of an eſſential branch of a <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Settlement,</hi> and that is <hi>peaceable Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,</hi> free from the diſturbance of other Claims and Pretenders. To talk of a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Poſſeſſion, when the Right Owner puts in his Claim, and actually proſecutes his Title, is to contradict the ſenſe of mankind. And he that will ſay, that a Poſſeſſion without either Right or Peace, that when there is a diſpute about the poſſeſſion, but none at all about the Right or Title, is a <hi>Thorough Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> He may ſay any thing, and make words ſignifie what he pleaſe: He may tell us if he will, that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation</hi> ſignifies Law and Right; that <hi>Rebellion</hi> ſignifies <hi>Allegiance;</hi> that <hi>Breach of Faith</hi> ſignifies <hi>Fidelity;</hi> for theſe are not greater contraries to each other. And this I had told him before, <q>When there is a Proſecution but of a pretended Right,<note place="margin">Poſtſcript, p. 2.</note> it cannot fairly be ſaid, that ſuch a poſſeſſion is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſettled, but when there is a plain, viſible, and indiſputable Legal Right againſt a Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor, and that Right actually proſecuted, in ſuch a Caſe to call bare poſſeſſion a <hi>Thorough Settlement,</hi> is one of the ſtrangeſt things in the World.</q> But this the Dr. thought fit to let alone, and yet he ſayes but juſt before, <hi>that he hath <hi>particularly</hi> anſwer'd all the little appearances of Reaſon and Arguments in the Poſtſcript:</hi> and methinks if this would not have paſs'd with him for a <hi>Reaſon,</hi> it might at leaſt have gone for a <hi>little appearance of Reaſon,</hi> and might have been anſwer'd. Well! <hi>but the Convocation mean the Settlement of a Government within it ſelf, not with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to foreign force and power.</hi> No doubt of it: for when a Prince and People have given up their Right and ſubmitted, what has a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power to do in the matter? And if the Dr. pleaſe to prove, that the Natural and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal King is a foreigner, I ſuppoſe it may do his Argument ſome ſervice. But this is juſt ſuch another Argument at this, if one man uſurps upon another's Right, and unjuſtly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes himſelf of his Eſtate, if the Right Owner can manage the Suit againſt him with his own Money, or with the Rent and Revenue of the Eſtate, then the Poſſeſſor is not <hi>ſettled</hi> in his poſſeſſion; but if he borrows the money to manage it, then the other is as firmly ſettled as can be. But the Convocation expreſs it, <hi>when they have eſtabliſh'd any of the ſaid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate forms of Government amongst their <hi>own</hi> people.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Convoc. p. 57.</note> But that ſame <hi>own</hi> is his own; for it is not in the <hi>Convocation Book</hi> (which I note only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind the Doctor, that <hi>little particles</hi> may ſlip from his Pen, as well as from others; and may make him a little more cautious, how he treats his Adverſaries too ſeverely on that account). And what then? Why then they have not eſtabliſh'd the ſaid forms of Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <hi>other</hi> people: And it would be an extraordinary Eſtabliſhment indeed, if the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of a Government in <hi>England</hi> ſhould be eſtabliſh'd in <hi>China,</hi> or among the People of other Nations. And where I wonder ſhould a form of Government be eſtabliſh'd, but among the people where it is eſtabliſh'd. And this is all the myſterie of the buſineſs, and all the Convocation meant by it. And what is this to the purpoſe? This ſhews indeed, that an Eſtabliſhment among one people, is not an Eſtabliſhment among another people; but this does not ſhew, that Uſurpation, is an <hi>eſtabliſh'd</hi> Government by the conſent of the people, when there is an undoubted Right and Title a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually proſecuted againſt it. But I think it ſhews, that the ſenſe of the Convocation is clean contrary, and the way of Expreſſion, which the Convocation here uſes, ſeems a good argument againſt the Drs. interpretation; for had they thought that the <hi>Conſent of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> was the main or only thing that <hi>eſtabliſh'd</hi> and <hi>ſetled</hi> any ſuch new Government, here was the faireſt occaſion to have expreſs'd it, and it can hardly be ſuppos'd they ſhould do otherwiſe; and had they been of the Doctor's mind, they muſt have expreſs'd it thus, <hi>When they have eſtabliſh'd any of the ſaid degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate forms of Government <hi>by the conſent of the people.</hi>
               </hi> And I believe no fair Reaſon can be given, why they did not ſo expreſs it, if
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107829:77"/> they had believed it. The Dr. makes it a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the interpretation of a Thorough Settlement by the acquiſition of Right.<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 4.</note> 
               <hi>If</hi> (ſays he) <hi>this had been their meaning, it had been eaſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y ſaid, and had prevented all miſtakes about it.</hi> And in the preſent Caſe, if this had been their meaning, it had not only been as eaſily ſaid (which proves nothing) but it had been unreaſonable not to have ſaid it. It had been the plain and natural expreſſion of their ſenſe: and if they intended it, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable, why they ſhould not expreſs it. Here they ſpeak of the <hi>people,</hi> and with reſpect alſo to the Eſtabliſhment of a New Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if the conſent of the people in their judgments, had been the only thing that eſtabliſh'd ſuch Governments, in all fair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, it ought to have been expreſs'd, when the nature of the thing, the ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the form of expreſſion, all directly lead them to it. But inſtead of that, all that they ſay, is, that ſuch New Governments are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd <hi>amongst their people,</hi> But not by them, nor by their conſent. And I think from thence, there is all the reaſon in the World to conclude, that it was not their ſenſe, that the Conſent of the people, was the only, or the main thing that ſettled a New Government. And this is one Argument more againſt the Drs. interpretation of the ſenſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</p>
            <p>I now come to his Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 74.</note> of what I alledg'd out of Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Buckeridge,</hi> two Members of this Convocation, and of Dr. <hi>Jackson,</hi> a Learned Divine of thoſe times, againſt the Drs. ſenſe of the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>Now here the Dr. tells me, <hi>The thing I am to prove from them is, that thoſe who aſcend the Throne by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation without a Legal Right, have not God's Authority, and muſt not be obey'd, and that ſuch Princes can never in the ſenſe of the Convocation, be ſettled in their Thrones, or have God's Authority, 'till they gain ſome new Legal Right, by the Death or Ceſſion of the Rightful Prince, or by a long Preſcription.</hi> And what need is there of all this? It is not ſufficient againſt him and his ſenſe of the Convocation, if I prove from them, that Uſurpers are no Kings, nor have God's Authority, nor have the duties of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects belonging to them? I did not cite them to juſtifie my Reaſons (which yet would be eaſie enough to do) but againſt that interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And that they are expreſly againſt it, will appear upon Examination.</p>
            <p>The firſt is Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> who was a very Learned Member of that Convocation, and underſtood the ſenſe of it as well as the Dr. and it is not very probable, that what he had, determin'd for Doctrine ſolemnly and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, be would contradict, and deliver the clean contrary in his particular Writings. I crave leave to cite the whole, becauſe the Dr. hath not, that ſo we may the better ſee the Drs. Evaſions. Upon theſe words, <hi>By me Kings reign</hi> (Prov. 8.15.) he tells, that the Act <hi>Regnant</hi> is twofold: <hi>Some are</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>Kings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſw. to Pamphl. p. 27.</note> 
               <hi>and yet reign not (as true Heirs defeated) and ſome reign, and are no Kings (as do all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers on the Throne</hi> per fas nefaſque) <hi>always it is one thing to be a King, another to reign;</hi> Joaſh <hi>was true King all thoſe ſix years he reigned not;</hi> Athaliah <hi>reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all thoſe ſix years, yet true Queen ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any: of ſuch God ſaith,</hi> Hoſ. 8.9. Regnaverunt ſed non à me. <hi>Why? for</hi> per me Regnes Regnant, <hi>by me Kings reign, Kings of lawful and true deſcent, they reign by me: Thoſe were none ſuch, ſo they reigned without any</hi> per <hi>from me; but when theſe meet, and they that be</hi> Reges de jure regnant de facto, <hi>then it is as it ſhould be, and</hi> per me <hi>it is that they ſo meet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this the Dr. ſayes, <hi>The whole of it is no more but this, that the Biſhop wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l not allow the name of King, to any but Kings of lawful and true deſcent; they are Kings, tho they reign not, as</hi> Joaſh <hi>was; others are no Kings, but <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers, tho they reign, as</hi> Athaliah <hi>did. And</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>what is this to the purpoſe?</hi> Truly not very much, as the Dr. hath order'd the matter. He would fain perſwade his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that all the difference between the Biſhop and him, is only about a <hi>Name,</hi> as if the ſaying <hi>they are,</hi> and <hi>they are not Kings,</hi> meant no more than they are, or they are not
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107829:78"/> ſo called: the aſſerting the Right Heir to be King, tho he does not reign, and the Uſurper to be no King, tho he does reign, according to him, is nothing at all but a trifling diſpute about names. And when the Biſhop ſayes, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways one thing it is to be a King, another to Reign,</hi> he only meant a nominal difference, and nothing at all beſides. For the Dr. tells us, <hi>the whole is no more but this he will not a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the name of King,</hi> &amp;c. Now I am ſo well acquainted with the Drs. faculty at inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, as not at all to wonder at this: But he muſt have a very mean opinion of his Readers, that can think ſuch things will go down with them: Is it poſſible, that any thing can be expreſs'd more contradictory, than the Biſhops aſſertions here are to the Drs. The Biſhop ſayes, <hi>Some are Kings, and yet reign not as true Heirs;</hi> the Dr. ſayes the contrary, <hi>He ought to be King, but is not; the man is in being, but the King is gone:</hi> The Biſhop ſayes, <hi>ſome Reign, and are no Kings, as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;</hi> the Dr. ſays, that all that reign are Kings, and particularly <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers.</hi> The Biſhop ſayes, that lawful Kings, reign by God; and Uſurpers do not; the Dr. the clean contrary. And yet the Dr. can with great Modeſty ask, <hi>What is this to the purpoſe?</hi> Alas, nothing at all; only it contradicts every thing in the Drs. two Books. But (ſayes he) <hi>does not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation allow</hi> Joaſh <hi>to be the true Heir while he was kept from the Crown?</hi> How nicely does he expreſs this, <hi>the True Heir?</hi> Yes, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation does not only allow him to be the <hi>True Heir,</hi> but the <hi>True King</hi> alſo, tho the Dr. does not, but dates his Authority from his Coronation; and is not this very pretty? The Biſhop ſayes, Joaſh <hi>was true King all thoſe ſix years he reigned not:</hi> and the Dr. anſwers, he was the true Heir, <hi>i. e.</hi> he was not the true King: for according to his Principles, there is as much difference between the <hi>true Heir,</hi> and the <hi>true King,</hi> as there is between ſomething and nothing; <hi>And</hi> Athaliah <hi>an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, tho ſhe reigned ſix years?</hi> Right! the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation does ſay ſo; and ſo does the Biſhop, and ſo does the Doctor. But here is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the Biſhop ſayes, <hi>Athaliah was never any true Queen,</hi> the Dr. ſayes ſhe was; and as true a Queen, as <hi>Joaſh</hi> was a King, bating on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the irreſiſtableneſs of her Authority; nay, in the matter now compar'd, ſhe was a true <hi>Queen,</hi> than <hi>Joaſh</hi> was a <hi>King;</hi> for, for thoſe ſix years ſhe was a <hi>true Queen,</hi> and <hi>Joaſh</hi> was only a <hi>true Heir, i. e.</hi> ſhe was Queen, and <hi>Joaſh</hi> was not King. A very fair Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! The Biſhops words are, <hi>Joaſh</hi> was King, and <hi>Athaliah</hi> was not Queen all thoſe ſix years, and the Drs. ſenſe is, <hi>Athaliah</hi> was Queen, and <hi>Joaſh</hi> was not King all thoſe ſix years. And yet the <hi>Biſhop might be of his mind, tho he would not allow them the name of Kings.</hi> Yes, juſt as much as two perſons are of the ſame mind, who manifeſtly contradict each other: What he adds about the Convocation's ſpeaking of a King <hi>de facto,</hi> and what Doctrine he hath prov'd from thence, I have anſwer'd already. But for him to ſay, that notwithſtanding his ſaying, that <hi>true Heirs who reign not, i. e.</hi> in the Drs. language are out of poſſeſſion, are the true Kings, that Uſurpers who reign, <hi>i. e.</hi> are in poſſeſſion of the Throne, are not true Kings; Biſhop <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> might be of the <hi>ſame mind with the Doctor</hi> as to obedience to ſuch Uſurpers, is to ſuppoſe all his Readers out of their wits. For if any man can believe, that that Learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop did think, that the Duties <hi>only</hi> belonging to a King, were due to a Perſon whom he thought to be no King, and were not due to the Perſon whom he thought was the King; it is high time to leave diſputing, and go range our ſelves in the Foreſt: For we muſt give over communicating our minds, if the ſenſe of men cannot be learnt from the plaineſt Expreſſions.</p>
            <p>The Dr. goes on, <hi>But the Biſhop will not allow, that ſuch Kings</hi> (if he pleaſes, ſuch U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers, and no Kings; for that is the Biſhop's Expreſſion) <hi>reigned by God.</hi> Right! <hi>But then he does not mean, that ſuch Kings do not <hi>exerciſe</hi> God's Authority; But that God did not by his antecedent will and app int<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, place them on the Throne.</hi> But how does the Dr. know that, or where had he this? Does the Biſhop ſay, or in the leaſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate any ſuch thing? No matter for that; the Dr. is reſolv'd to make him ſay ſo, becauſe it is for his purpoſe. And is not this a pure Interpreter of Authors? What Authority has he to make ſenſes for men, which they never made themſelves? He might have ſaid, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:107829:79"/> with the ſame Juſtice and Truth, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop when he ſaid, Uſurpers were no Kings, he <hi>meant</hi> they were Kings, when he ſaid, they did not reign by God, he <hi>meant</hi> they did reign by him. Grant but this liberty, that men may clap their own <hi>diſtinctions</hi> upon others, and we may eaſily make them ſay what we pleaſe: and at this rate the Dr. may make Biſhops, or Convocations, or any body elſe, ſpeak what he hath a mind to. Let him ſhew if he can, where this diſtinction of <hi>Exerciſing God's Authority, tho not Reigning by him,</hi> and of his <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Will,</hi> are in Biſhop <hi>Andrews.</hi> And if he can't, let him try if he can make another di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, to avoid the charge of <hi>inventing a ſenſe, and faſtning it upon the Biſhop, to ſerve his own turn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He adds, <hi>Thus St.</hi> Chryſoſtom <hi>on the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth to the</hi> Romans, why did Biſhop <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> cite St. <hi>Chryſoſtom?</hi> Nor that neither; nor had any reference to him: and how then comes St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> to explain the Biſhop's ſenſe? Suppoſe St <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> was of that mind, does it follow, that therefore the Biſhop was? If this be not his meaning, what does he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by his Particle <hi>[thus]?</hi> Well! but <hi>thus <hi>St.</hi>
               </hi> Chryſoſtom <hi>on the thirteenth to the</hi> Romans: why, doth St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſay any thing, <hi>of ſuch Kings exerciſing God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, tho God did not by his antecedent will and appointment place them on the Throne?</hi> nor that neither; but the Dr. hath taken this diſtinction from Dr. <hi>Jackson,</hi> and faſtned it upon Biſhop <hi>Buckeridge</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> tho neither of them ſay one word of it, nor any thing like it. And in truth, in reference to Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> himſelf, he both miſtakes and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applyes it, as we ſhall ſee preſently. But as for St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> the Dr. tell us, <hi>he allows all power and authority to be of God, and to be ordained of God, and therefore ought not to be reſiſted, whoever has it: but yet will not ſay, that all Princes, who exerciſe this Power wickedly and tyrannically, whatever their Title be, are ordained of God.</hi> But where had the Dr. this? St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> (as far as I can find) ſays nothing of this. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him, of <hi>whoever has this power:</hi> He ſayes indeed, the Apoſtle does not ſay, <hi>There is no Governour, but what is of God, but he ſpeaks of the thing it ſelf, there is no power but of God.</hi> And from whence I think it plainly follows, That a Governour, or in the Drs. words, one that actually governs, might not be of God, and conſequently, ſuch a one is not within the Precept of the Apoſtle, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to St. <hi>Chryſoſtom.</hi> But the Dr. gives a Reaſon, <hi>He</hi> (St. <hi>Chryſoſtom) thought it a reproach and blemiſh to the Goodneſs and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Providence, to ſay that wicked, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, tyrannical Princes, were ordained by God; but yet granted, that the Authority they exerciſed was God's, and muſt be obey'd.</hi> But this is all his own, and a Reaſon he hath made for St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> to make him ſpeak what he thinks fit; for where does St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> ſay any thing <hi>of reproaching and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing the Juſtice and Goodneſs of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence?</hi> And where does he ſay, that the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> exercis'd, <hi>was God's Authority, and ought to be obey'd,</hi> whatever the Perſons were; or as the Dr. ſayes before, <hi>whatever their Title be?</hi> Upon this the Controverſie turns, and St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> hath not the leaſt word of it. And I believe any man that attentively conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders St <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> will find, that he delivers a Doctrine directly contrary to what the Doctor hath made for him. For he plainly intimates, that all Governours are not of God, tho Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment it ſelf is; and when he comes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this, he does it by an alluſion from Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; That <hi>a woman is joyned to a man by God, that is, by God's Inſtitution of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, not that every one that co-habits with a Woman, is therefore joyn'd to her by God.</hi> Now if it will be admitted, that this alluſion explains St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s meaning (and I think that cannot be doubted) then we have a pretty clear account of what he means, when he ſayes, all Governours are not ordain'd of God; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is of Divine Inſtitution, as well as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: But as every man that co-habits with a woman in the Drs. phraſe, <hi>is in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> is not therefore joyn'd by God, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> is any Matrimonial Relation contracted; ſo every one that poſſeſſes the Throne, is not therefore ordain'd of God for a Prince or Ruler; an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer is not a Husband of God's making, however he may unlawfully or providentially co-habit with a woman: nor is an Uſurper a King of God's making, however he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially exerciſe the Government: and the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:107829:79"/> Doctor may as well ſay, that St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> granted that any man that co-habits with a woman ought to be obey'd, and to have the duties belonging to a Husband pay'd to him, tho they are not joyn'd together by God, as that he grants, that a Governour exerciſes God's Authority, and ought to be obey'd, tho he will not allow that ſuch Governours are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd of God.</p>
            <p>The Doctor adds, <hi>The Biſhop and others will allow what St.</hi> Chryſoſtom <hi>would not, that moſt wicked Tyrants, who have a Legal Title,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 75.</note> 
               <hi>are ordain'd of God, but are afraid to own that Princes, who aſcend their Thrones by unjuſt means, are ſet up by God; but it does not hence follow, that they deny'd their power and authority to be God's, or that Subjects ought to obey it.</hi> And he adds, <hi>the Convocation affirms no more in that mighty place.</hi> And then he concludes, <hi>ſo that Learned men may differ in this point, whether illegal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers are placed in the Throne, by the over-ruling Counſels and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God, or only by his permiſſive Providence, and yet agree in the main Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, That the Authority they exerciſe, when ſettled in their Thrones, is God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and muſt be obey'd.</hi> Now this is a dextrous method of interpretation, and a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way to avoid the force of any Allegations. And Authors muſt be very ſtiff and ſtubborn, if they will not yield and be brought over, when we may make diſtinctions for them, which they never made themſelves, and then draw a ſenſe for them out of our own Diſtinctions. The Queſtion is concerning the ſenſe of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Andrews:</hi> The Doctor cites St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom,</hi> to prove the Biſhop's ſenſe; and to make that good, he ſayes, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and others will allow more than St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> would; and at length concludes, <hi>That Learned Men may differ as to the placing an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper on the Throne, whether by the Counſel or permiſſion of God, and agree in the main concluſion, that they exerciſe God's Authority.</hi> But where I pray, is this difference? And where is this agreement? is there any thing like it in Biſhop <hi>Andrews?</hi> Not a word of that. He tells us indeed, <hi>we have an expreſs determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this matter by Dr.</hi> Jackſon. And ſuppoſe we have, what is that to the purpoſe? We are not now enquiring into Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi>'s ſenſe, but into Biſhop <hi>Andrew</hi>'s ſenſe: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> did differ with the Dr. about God's Council, and permiſſion of Uſurpers and yet agree in the main Concluſion, does it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> did ſo likewiſe? or that when he ſayes, Kings that reign not, are true Kings, and Uſurpers that reign, are not Kings, he ſpeaks it with reference to ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, or to ſuch agreement, tho he hath not the leaſt word or intimation of it, nor any thing like it? But of this before.</p>
            <p>And now let us ſee what Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> ſays, the Doctor tells <hi>me,</hi> it is <hi>in that very Sermon to which I appeal.</hi> The words that concern the Controverſie are theſe: <q>But doth the Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Doth every one which reſiſts the Magiſtrate, or men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with the power of Juriſdiction, reſiſt the Ordinance of God, as directly, or in as high degree, as he that reſiſts the Power it ſelf, wherewith he is inveſted, as he that ſeeks to overthrow the Magiſtracy?</q> And then he repeats the obſervation of S. <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> who obſerve, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks not of this or that Magiſtrate in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, <hi>ſed de re ipſa,</hi> and then asks, Is there any power, not inherent in ſome mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? Any Magiſtracy without, a Magiſtrate? And from thence concludes, the Magiſtrate muſt not be reſiſted, as well as the Magiſtracy. The Doctor hath repeated this at large, but for what purpoſe I cannot imagine: for how does any thing here, concern the diſpute between us? He adds, <hi>that in the next Section Dr.</hi> Jackſon <hi>makes a great difference between the power it ſelf, and the acquaſition or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of power.</hi> 
               <q>That our Apoſtles Rule doth not ſo punctually hold, of the means of acquiſition of power, or of the exerciſe of it, as it doth of the power, or Magiſtracy it ſelf, albeit the power or Magiſtracy be always <hi>God's poſitive and primary Ordinance</hi> always an effect of his gracious Providence, always a bleſſing to any Land or People; or the <hi>award of his antecedent will;</hi> yet the manner of acquiring this power, or the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing it to this or that perſon, is not always the <hi>poſitive Ordinance of God,</hi> no effect of his bounty and benignity, no conſequent

And let any impartial and unprejudic'd Reader judge, if the Doctor's Hypotheſis and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Convocation be not as direct a contradiction to this as words can make it. The Biſhop makes a manifeſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Prince by Right and Title, and an Uſurper, with reſpect to the Peoples Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that a lawful King tho he rules tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally muſt not be reſiſted, that an Uſurper is no King but an Enemy, and may be reſiſted as an Enemy. Nay he adds further,<note place="margin">Communis opinio eſt, quod in hoc caſt. licet unicuique ſubdito ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem Tyrannum &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſorem occidere. <hi>ib.</hi>

The Doctor ſays, that ſuch Princes in poſſeſſion of the Throne without Title ought to be <hi>obey'd</hi> for Conſcience ſake; the Biſhop ſays they may be <hi>reſiſted and kill'd.</hi> But this the Doctor did not think fit to meddle with tho it directly affects him, and the whole deſign of his book; but inſtead of that fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He tells me, <hi>I did well to cite the Paſſage honeſtly, but not ſo to corrupt it with my comment; for (ſays he) he turns a disjunctive into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive: The Biſhop ſays, <hi>neither by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the People, nor by the preſcription of ſix years,</hi> which ſuppoſes that either the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the People or a long preſcription would give a Right; and he expounds it of both together,</hi> That a Right to the Government is acqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And I dare be bold to ſay, that that <hi>Author,</hi> nor any man elſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ever thought of it before, except it had been with thoughts of abhorrence: for 'tis a Notion with a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi> in the belly on't, and plainly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in <hi>Commonwealth</hi> Principles: for if the Conſent of the People can make Allegiance become a duty contrary to Laws and Oaths, their Diſſent may make it no duty contrary to the ſame Laws and Oaths. If their Conſent can make one King, or (which is the ſame thing) make their Allegiance due to him when by the Laws and their Oaths they have obligations to another, they may make or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker Kings as often as they pleaſe; for their conſenting to one is the diſcharging another, and at length all the buſineſs of Governments will be reſolv'd into the Peoples Conſent. But to return.</p>
            <p>But does not the Biſhop ſay, <hi>That</hi> Athaliah <hi>had not acquir'd a Right to the Crown, neither by the Conſent of the People, nor by the Preſcription of ſix years?</hi> Right, but what follows is not ſo, <hi>which ſhews what his judgment was that ſuch an Uſurper as</hi> Athaliah <hi>might acquire a Right to the Crown, either by the Conſent of the People or long Continuance. Bellarmine</hi> indeed had obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, That <hi>Athaliah</hi>'s Government was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by the Peoples Conſent, and that ſhe had reigned quietly ſix years. And the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop anſwers, ſhe had acquir'd a Right neither by the Conſent of the People, nor by Preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. But it does not follow that therefore he thought the Conſent of the People <hi>in ſuch a caſe</hi> as <hi>Athaliah</hi>'s, where the right Heir was in being and claiming, would make a Right. He proves indeed they did not conſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ought not to have conſented, which is both againſt <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor; and one of his Reaſons is, <hi>That</hi> Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da <hi>had been a Traitor to the heir of the Crown, and to the King himſelf.</hi> And the Reaſon he gives of that is, (and let the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor obſerve it,<note place="margin">Filius enim in regnis haereditariis in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Now I own that is made in the Print, but it was not made in the Copy, which was carefully and <hi>verbatim</hi> tranſcrib'd from Dr. <hi>Jackson,</hi> but by the miſtake of the Printer, and I muſt tell the Doctor, I had not the Correction of the ſheets as they came from the Preſs, but they were forced to take their chance, and there were a great many more Errors than that; and 'tis likely there will be as many in this; and I know not how to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it. But after all, there was no need of ſuch an out-cry about it, for the change of that Particle makes no change in the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and 'tis equally valid againſt him with and without that Particle.</p>
            <p>The Doctor hath not tranſcrib'd what I ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of Dr. <hi>Jackson,</hi> but hath given us the next Paragraph, and appeals to the Reader on which ſide Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> is, and therefore I ſhall obſerve his method, and conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what he hath cited makes for him, and then ſhew how that which I have cited makes againſt him.</p>
            <p>The Paragraph is this, and the Doctor hath cited it at length: <hi>So then a Tyrant or Uſurper may be depoſed or reſiſted, but</hi> thus <hi>reſiſted he may not be by every man who knows him to be an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: for a man may tranſgreſs this Rule of the Apoſtle and reſiſt God's Ordinance by reſiſting the power wherewith he is inveſted, tho not ſimply by reſiſting him,</hi> Aliud eſt Magiſtratum eſſe aliud <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap> in Magiſtratu eſſe, aut Magiſtratum gerere. <hi>It is one thing to be a true and lawful Magiſtrate, another thing to bear or execute the office of a true Magiſtrate. The Acts of a falſe Magiſtrate or Intruder, whilſt he is in</hi> Magiſtratu <hi>in the office it ſelf, are of validity, his Perſon is to be obey'd, not reſiſted by every man, untill he be declared to be an Uſurper or Intruder by ſome higher Power or Authority. Few Tyrants have gotten inveſtiture or admiſſion to Royal Power by more indirect means than</hi> Richard III. <hi>in this Kingdom did, yet many Acts and Exerciſes of Royal Power, tho proceeding from him, were legal, and of validity; nor did they reſiſt the Ordinance of God that bare office under him, and obey'd his Summons, whether for Parliament, or other buſineſs of State. <hi>It had been a ſin for any man of his own private head to have kill'd him,</hi> a belt all the ſpace of his reign he did reſiſt the Ordinance of God; this belongs to the higher Powers only, or unto them to whom the ſupreme Power by Right is annexed: and ſo</hi> Henry <hi>of</hi> Richmond <hi>was authorized by God's Ordinance to execute Vengeance and to bring Condemnation on this Tyrant, which every man

            </p>
            <p>This is the intire Paragraph, which the Dr. <hi>leaves his Reader to judge on which ſide Dr.</hi> Jackſon <hi>is,</hi> and I will leave <hi>him</hi> to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe plain propoſitions are not deducible from it, and then let him make his beſt of the reſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That every man may not reſiſt an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, tho he knows him to be ſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Acts of a falſe Magiſtrate or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder, while he is in the office are of validity, his Perſon is to be obeyed and not reſiſted by every man.

            <p>We are now come to matter of fact, the Caſe of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third: And from what Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> ſays<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe things are plain.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Richard</hi> the Third came to be inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with Royal Power by very indirect means.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That many Acts of Royal Power tho pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from him were legal.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That they that bore office under him, or obeyed his ſummons to Parliament did not reſiſt the Ordinance of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That it had been a ſin for any man <hi>of his own private head</hi> to have killed him. And this the Dr. hath put into great black letters, as if there were ſome very great matter in it: But in truth it is nothing at all, for I do not know that it is a Queſtion between us, whether any man <hi>of his own private head</hi> may kill an Uſurper, whatever ſome learned men have ſaid about it. But this I can tell him, that Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing it with this cautious limitation, plainly ſuppoſes that be thought it might be done by private men, tho not of their own private Heads. And therefore,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Every man is not Avenger of ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the ordinance of God, i. e. of Uſurpers, which plainly ſuppoſes that ſome men are: And Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> immediatly tells us who are, <hi>This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Higher Powers only, or unto them to whom the Supreme Power by right is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed,</hi> i. e. The Rightful Prince hath Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and is an Avenger of an Uſurper. And ſo <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Richmond was authorized by God's Ordinance,</hi> i. e. he was the Right Heir for that the Dr. plainly means by <hi>God's Ordinance,</hi> (This indeed is a miſtake in Hiſtory, but that is nothing to the Argument) and upon that account, had authority to execute vengeance on him; <hi>which every one might not, which perhaps no other might have done ſave only in his right and intereſt, and by his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Command;</hi> i. e. tho others may not do it of their own private heads, yet they may in the right and intereſt, and by the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Command of the Right Heir. And now we have it with the <hi>Conjunctive,</hi> and what hath the Dr. to ſay to it? he tells us, <hi>who ever doubted,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 77.</note> 
               <hi>but a Rightful Prince, when diſpoſſeſſed unjuſtly may recover his Throne if he can, and diſpoſſeſs the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, or that thoſe who lawfully receive Commiſſions from him may
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107829:83"/> lawfully fight in his quarrel. But the great Queſtion ſtill remains, whether Subjects may lawfully take Commiſſion from the diſpoſſeſſed Prince, to fight againſt the Prince, who is ſetled in the poſſeſſion of the Throne; this Dr.</hi> Jackſon <hi>does not ſay, and therefore he can do our Author no ſervice.</hi> Right he does not ſay it, nor was there any reaſon for it, but this he ſays, that the Right Heir, or diſpoſſeſſed Prince is the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> and it is a <hi>great Queſtion</hi> indeed, whether the Subjects may <hi>lawfully</hi> take a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> from the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> and the inſtance makes this as clear as the Sun, Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> ſays, <hi>perhaps no other Perſon might have done it, ſave only in <hi>his</hi> right and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and by <hi>his</hi> commiſſion and command;</hi> and in whoſe right and intereſt, &amp;c. did he mean? why truly in the right and intereſt, and by the commiſſion and command of <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond;</hi> and who I pray were the men that took Commiſſions of him, and fought for him? why truly no body elſe, but the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> even at the ſame time that the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per actually governed; and then the Subjects may lawfully take Commiſſions from the Right Heir, to fight againſt the Prince, who is ſetled in the Poſſeſſion of the Throne. The truth is any man who is not concern'd it ſhould mean otherwiſe, will eaſily ſee, that what Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> here obviates is the reſiſting or killing an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of a mans <hi>own private head,</hi> but by no means to prejudice the Right and Intereſt of the Lawful Prince; as appears plainly by the former limitation, <hi>that the Acts of a falſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate are of validity, and his Perſon is to be obeyed, <hi>until</hi> he be declared an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper by ſome Higher Power.</hi> And the Caſe of <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> is but an example to illuſtrate the Doctrine he had before delivered; and when <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Richmond</hi> had declared <hi>Richard</hi> an Uſurper, (as he manifeſtly did by making war upon him) the validity of his Acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Obedience to his Perſon fell from him, and centred in the Higher Powers and in the Ordinance of God; and 'tis ridiculous to queſtion the lawfulneſs of taking Commiſſions from the Higher Powers, to fight againſt a Prince who hath no Authority, and when there is no obedience due to him. And by this time the Dr. may ſee what great Reaſon he had to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to his Reader <hi>to judge on which ſide Dr.</hi> Jackſon <hi>is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the validity of the Acts of Government by an Uſurper, the Dr. may be ſatisfied in the <hi>Caſe of Allegiance to a King</hi> de facto. And that worthy Author hath ſince given him abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>We have now ſeen how much that which <hi>he</hi> hath cited out of Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> makes for him, in the next place let us conſider, how much that which I have cited makes againſt him, he did not care to repeat it; but thus it is as much as concerns the Caſe of Uſurpation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He who is a mere <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, or a Tyrant by Title may be reſiſted by violence even to depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or death, albeit he happens to exerciſe his power with ſuch moderation, as would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a juſt and lawful King; — it is a truth unqueſtionable, that a Tyrant by Title,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>may be reſiſted without reſiſting the Ordinance of God: And the Reaſon is plain, for that he could neither uſurp, nor continue his power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than by reſiſting ſome Higher Powers, or by reſiſting the Ordinance of God;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others he inſtances, <hi>in caſe he uſurp or exerciſes Royal Authority over ſuch as have been formerly governed by Royal Succeſſion; he openly reſiſts power much higher than his own, whether this power be <hi>yet actually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed</hi> to ſome known Perſons, that have Right or Title to the Kingdom by Succeſſion, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in defect of the Antient Royal Iſſue,</hi> &amp;c. from hence theſe things are plain.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That an Uſurper may juſtly be reſiſted and depoſed, and therefore he hath not the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable Authority of a Sovereign Prince. And the Drs. Title to his Book, and his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis do not agree; the Title <hi>is the Caſe of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance due to <hi>Sovereign Princes:</hi>
               </hi> And his Hypotheſis concerns only obedience to <hi>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped Powers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The formal reaſon why they may be reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or depoſed is, becauſe they reſiſt ſome <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> or they reſiſt the <hi>Ordinance of God;</hi> and from whence it plainly and undeniably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Uſurpers are not the <hi>Higher Powers</hi> nor the <hi>Ordinance of God,</hi> for 'tis a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to ſay, that thoſe are the <hi>Higher Powers</hi> or the <hi>Ordinance of God,</hi> whoſe very eſſence and conſtitution conſiſts in reſiſting them And this ſtrikes at the Root of both the Doctors Books.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:107829:84"/>2. That the Right Heir or the King out of poſſeſſion, is the Higher Power and the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, for otherwiſe it could not be ſaid, that <hi>an intruder into the Office Royal could <hi>never</hi> uſurp or <hi>continue</hi> his power other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by reſiſting ſome higher power or the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And therefore whatever may be due to an Uſurper in the exerciſe of Royal Power in indifferent caſes, nothing can be due to him in prejudice of the Right Heir, for our duty to the place and power the Uſurper holds (which is the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> allows) can never be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to the wrong and injury of the Perſon, to whom that place and power of Right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, and whoſe it is: For I hope no duty to Uſurpers will excuſe us for reſiſting the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> and the <hi>Ordinance of God;</hi> and if the Right Heir be the <hi>Higher Power</hi> and the <hi>Ordinance of God,</hi> then whoſoever reſiſts him, reſiſts the <hi>Higher Power</hi> and the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God:</hi> And I would fain know, if the Uſurper by reſiſting the Rightful Prince, reſiſts the <hi>Higher Power</hi> and the <hi>Ordinance of God,</hi> why alſo every man elſe that reſiſts the rightful Prince does not likewiſe reſiſt, the <hi>Higher Power</hi> &amp; the <hi>Ordinance of God.</hi> And the Dr. may trie if he has a diſtinction that can make it a duty to obey Uſurp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have one thing more to obſerve from hence, and that is, that the Rightful King out of Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion is not only the <hi>Higher Power,</hi> but that he has the Power <hi>actually</hi> annex'd to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for thus Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> expreſſes it, the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>openly reſiſts Power much higher than his own, whether the Power be yet <hi>actually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed</hi> to ſome known Perſons that have Right or Title to the Kingdom by ſucceſſion;</hi> which overthrows at leaſt one half of his two books, and all his Arguments about <hi>actual</hi> Authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And beſides fully anſwers his little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception about receiving Commiſſions from them; for it is ridiculous and a contradiction to talk of Power being <hi>actually</hi> annexed to the Perſon of a Prince, when he cannot exerciſe any <hi>Acts</hi> of Power and Authority.</p>
            <p>The Dr. comes to examine another citation I produced out of Dr. <hi>Jackson.</hi> And uſhers it in with this laudable preface; <hi>But this he has ſo ſhamefully mangled, that a little diſcretion would have taught him rather to have left it out, then to have betrayed ſo much diſhoneſty in his quotations.</hi> Theſe are hard words, and the Dr. is bound in honour to make them good, for it is <hi>ſhameleſs</hi> with a witneſs to charge a man at this rate, and have nothing to ſay to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie it; And let us ſee what it is he does ſay: He ſays, <hi>he will give the Reader the entire paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1.

I wonder he did not charge me with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty for not quoting the whole Sermon.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107829:84"/> the Dr. it was never vacant, and conſequently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him <hi>Jehoiada</hi> never had any ſuch Authority. But the truth is the Throne was vacant all the time the Uſurper poſſeſſed it, i. e. it was not legally fill'd: And <hi>Jehoiada</hi> as a Prime Peer of the Kingdom was to take care and to exerciſe his Authority, that the Right Heir might be reſtored; as Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> ſays, <hi>In the Right of this Prince, and for the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al annexion of the Supreme Power to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (unto whom it was</hi> de jure <hi>annexed</hi>) Jehoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada <hi>being the chief Magiſtrate, did by force and violence depoſe her.</hi> And not as the Dr. ſeems to inſinuate, that he had any power to make a Deciſion of a controverſie between the Right Heir, and the Uſurper, and which way ſoever he determined it, the People were bound to acquieſce; for Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> adds, <hi>that is not merely in his Right of Prieſthood, as the Papiſts pretend, nor merely as a Subject, but as being the Higher Power and Authority to whom the judgment of ſuch matters belonged, as he had obſerved before;</hi> what have we got here? can the Prime Peer of a Kingdom judge authoritatively and judicially of Kings? if the Dr. could perſuade Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> to ſay this, it might do his Hypotheſis of the <hi>Peoples conſent in Parliament</hi> ſome ſervice; but his Doctrine about providence would ſuffer as much by it on the other hand, for then there would be a <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal</hi> on Earth for the deciſion of differences between Kings and Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 46.</note> and then the Events of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence would make no difference between private injuries and uſurpations of Government. Let that go as it will, he tells us, Dr. <hi>Jackson had obſerved this before:</hi> Now indeed Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> did obſerve, that an Uſurper's Acts are of validity, &amp;c. <hi>till he be declared to be an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper by ſome <hi>Higher Power or Authority;</hi>
               </hi> now transfer this to <hi>Athaliah</hi> and <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> and ſee what wiſe work we ſhall make on't, that is to ſay all the time of <hi>Athaliahs</hi> Uſurpation, <hi>Jehoiada</hi> was the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> and then <hi>Athaliah</hi>'s power muſt be inferiour to his; and ſo at laſt he has made a pure <hi>Queen</hi> of her, to have a Power inferiour and under the Authority of her own Subjects; for he tells us, Jehoiada <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to her and ought to be juſtified in it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 27.</note> But the truth is Dr <hi>Jackson</hi> obſerv'd nothing at all of this; by the <hi>Higher Powers</hi> he means, the <hi>Right Heir and Lawful King</hi> as I have ſhewed before; and in this very place the Dr. cites out of him; he ſays Jehoiada <hi>was inveſted with the Power of Juriſdiction <hi>next in order and dignity to the Higher Power;</hi>

               </gap>ge, But Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> ſays, expreſly <hi>in the Right of this Prince,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Infant</hi> Joaſh unto whoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>The Power Royal was by Right annexed.</hi> And to whom by virtue of his high Station, and his Relation to him as being the Kings Uncle, he might be Guardian; and therefore the fitteſt to preſide and manage that undertaking, but it does not therefore follow, that if he had negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it, or took part with the Uſurper, but any other Peer or Subject might have undertaken it in the ſame Right, and by the ſame Authority; and Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> plainly intimates it by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference he draws from hence which the Dr. conceals, tho he told us he would give the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the <hi>intire paſſage; Is it then all one in theſe mens Divinity, for a <hi>Subject or Peer</hi> of any Realm to ſtand for the Right of his Leige Lord againſt a Stranger or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper,</hi> &amp;c. So then it ſeems a <hi>Subject or Peer</hi> (and I hope <hi>or</hi> is a Disjunctive, a Subject that is not a Peer) may ſtand by the Right of his Leige Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an Uſurper as well as a Prime Peer. The Dr. here charges me with <hi>ſhamefully mangling</hi> this paſſage of Dr. <hi>Jackson,</hi> and I ſhall leave it with the Reader, whether he hath not <hi>ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully interpreted it.</hi> He adds, <hi>This is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry account the Convocation gives of it, that</hi> Jehoiada <hi>did this being the Kings <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle, and the chief Head and Prince of his Tribe, that is, not a private Subject, but a chief Prince in the Kingdom of</hi> Judah. Now the Dr. deals with the Convocation juſt as he hath done with Dr. <hi>Jackson,</hi> and to ſhew what a fair interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he makes I ſhall cite the paſſage: <q>Now after ſix years, that <hi>Joaſh,</hi> the true, and natural Heir apparent to the Crown, had been ſo brought up.<note place="margin">Convoc. p. 41.</note> He the ſaid <hi>Jehoiada</hi> being the Kings Uncle, and the chief Head or Prince of his tribe, ſent through <hi>Judah</hi> for the <hi>Levites</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:107829:85"/> nd chief Fathers both of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> to come unto him to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who accordingly repairing thither, and being made acquainted by him with the preſervation of their Prince, and that it was the Lords will that he ſhould reign over them; they altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a covenant acknowledged their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to him, as unto their Lawful King, and ſo diſpoſed of things, as preſently after he was crowned and anointed; which dutiful office of Subjects being performed, they apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Uſurper <hi>Athaliah</hi> and ſlew her, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was by the ſaid <hi>States</hi> reſolved. In all the proceſs of which action nothing was done, either by the High Prieſt, or by the reſt of the Princes and People of <hi>Judah,</hi> which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did not require at <hi>their</hi> hands:</q> And what is all this to Jehoiada's <hi>being the Higher Power and Authority to whom the judgment of ſuch matters belonged?</hi> where is any judicial or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative Act of his? he conven'd them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and which he might do as High Prieſt, and Prince of his Tribe, and acquainted them with the Preſervation of their Prince; and the Convocation attributes no more to him in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; but the acknowledgment of their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, and the buſineſs of depoſing and ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Athaliah</hi> was reſolved on by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; <hi>(by the ſaid States)</hi> There is nothing of Authority aſcrib'd to <hi>Jehoiada</hi> in this, and they expreſs it yet plainer in their <hi>Canon.</hi> 
               <q>Or that <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the High Prieſt was not bound, as he was a Prieſt both to <hi>inform</hi> the Princes and People, of the Lords promiſe, that <hi>Joaſh</hi> ſhould reign over them, and likewiſe to anoint him.</q> Now as I take it <hi>informing</hi> is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them, nor directing them by an act of Authority. And if <hi>Jehoiada</hi> had not done as he was <hi>bound,</hi> if he had not <hi>informed</hi> them, nay if he had <hi>informed</hi> them otherwiſe, yet if they had been <hi>informed</hi> any other way, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they might have done their duty, and have acknowledged their Allegiance to their natural Prince, and have reſolved together to depoſe and ſlay the Uſurper, what Authority ſoever <hi>Jehoiada</hi> had, or how much ſoever he had <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> or <hi>commanded</hi> them to the contrary; was it their duty to adhere to their natural Prince or not? if it was, the interpoſition of <hi>Jehoiada</hi>'s Authority either way could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence that; the great Authority of the High Prieſt might indeed facilitate and expedite the ſetting him on the Throne, but could not make that a duty which was not, nor make that ceaſe to be a duty which was ſo before.</p>
            <p>And now let me ask the Dr. where is the <hi>ſhameful mangling and diſhoneſty</hi> in my not citing this paſſage of <hi>Jehoiada</hi>'s being a <hi>Prime Peer, and inveſted with Power of juriſdiction next to the Higher Power?</hi> For what is that to the purpoſe for which I cited Dr. <hi>Jackson?</hi> The ſingle queſtion is, whether it be lawful to obey an Uſurper in poſſeſſion of the Throne, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Right Heir out of poſſeſſion; and what was the heigth of his Station, and the power of his Juriſdiction to that? as high as he was, it was not <hi>lawful</hi> for him, and his fact plainly declares it. His high dignity indeed made it reaſonable for him to interpoſe his Authority in behalf of the Right Heir, and was the fitteſt to conduct and manage an affair of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but it made no difference in the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the thing; for if it be unlawful for a <hi>Prime Peer</hi> to joyn himſelf to an Uſurper in oppoſition to the Rightful Prince, 'tis unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for a <hi>private Subject.</hi> And that was all that I was concerned in; it was foreign to the queſtion to meddle in the diſpute with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, to whom this was an Anſwer, for they urge this fact of <hi>Jehoiada</hi> as an Act of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity annexed to the Prieſthood, And the Dr. ſays in expreſs terms, That <hi>this was an Act of Authority and Juriſdiction.</hi> I will not return his ſcurrilous <hi>inuendo</hi> of <hi>looking kindly towards Rome;</hi> but he hath given the Papiſt greater advantage in this Controverſie than any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ever did: For if it be granted, that this was <hi>an Act of Juriſdiction</hi> and Authority in <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> the Queſtion hath a new face, and 'tis ſplitting an hair, whether that was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the High Prieſt, or of the Prime Peer; whereas all Proteſtants have fix'd it upon a clearer bottom, and ſay that what he did, was in the Right of his Prince, and not by any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his own; and remove the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie off of that bottom, and admit that <hi>Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> acted in a way of <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> it will be very difficult to prove, but that the High Prieſt, <hi>qua</hi> ſo, had the higheſt Authority in that State, next to the King; and conſequently if <hi>Jehoiada</hi> acted <hi>authoritatively</hi> it was in the capacity of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:107829:85"/> 
               <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> and not as the <hi>Kings <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle</hi> or as a <hi>Prime Peer.</hi>

And for a Stranger, no Native Member of this or the like Chriſtian Common-wealth, to throw down the Lawful King from his Throne? or to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize his Subjects or others, to do to him, as <hi>Jehoiada</hi> did to <hi>Athaliah?</hi> And to bring
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:107829:86"/> in a Stranger or Alien, as he to caſt out a Stranger or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper?</hi> This immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in Dr <hi>Jackson,</hi> and I had cited them <hi>verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim</hi> from him, which directly anſwer his Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, and which he perfectly ſuppreſſes, and yet tells his Reader, <hi>he would give him the entire paſſage;</hi> and yet notwithſtanding he could make this Preface to his Examination of this paſſage: <hi>But this</hi> (Citation from Dr. <hi>Jackson) he has ſo ſhamefully mangled,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 77, 78.</note> 
               <hi>that a little diſcretion would have taught him rather to have left it out</hi> (as it ſeems the Drs. <hi>diſcretion</hi> taught him to <hi>leave out</hi> what made againſt him) <hi>than to have betrayed ſo much diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty in his Quotations.</hi> Now all that I ſhall obſerve from hence is, that the Doctor is very clamorous in his charges, but very unfortunate withal; for they always turn upon him, and come home to him.</p>
            <p>The Dr. tells me, <hi>I conclude my Poſtſcript with Rage and Venom:</hi> that is to ſay, 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>furious</hi> and <hi>venemous</hi> to charge Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> with maintaining of <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> tho he hath done nothing elſe in his two laſt Books; and any man that hath heard of the Diſtinction of <hi>Tyrannus ſine Titulo, &amp; Tyrannus exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citio,</hi> is able to diſcover it. And he cannot be prevail'd upon to clear himſelf of it, but leaves it to a Learn'd Pen to do it for him; which is a ſmall demonſtration, that he cannot do it himſelf. It was very <hi>venemous</hi> too, I ſuppoſe, to joyn him in this matter with <hi>Goodwyn, Eaton,</hi> and ſuch as they: and I muſt confeſs, they are not very laudable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions: But people that maintain the ſame Doctrines and Opinions, have no great reaſon to quarrel at their company: And if he does not like them, he may try if he can tell where to get any better: Would he have had me joyn'd him with Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> when he hath uſed his utmoſt skill to confute him, or with Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and the other famous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of our Church, when they maintain the clean contrary to what he does?</p>
            <p>I had cited a paſſage out of his <hi>Caſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Powers,</hi>

               <hi>was the ſenſe of the Church of <hi>England</hi> at that time.</hi> And the Reaſon I gave for it was, <hi>for this paſſage was never queſtion'd, till he hath now done it himſelf.</hi> But this was ſo very <hi>venomous,</hi> that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor would not come near it. Well! he tells us, <hi>he hath changed his opinion indeed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Authority of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers.</hi> And I have nothing to ſay to that; he may change his opinion as often as he pleaſe. But he tells us, <hi>he has Scripture and Reaſon, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>to juſtifie this change.</hi> But I do not think theſe are half ſo changeable as the Doctor's Principles, nor will turn with the Compaſs, he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he had them before, and with as much aſſurance as he does now: And whether he hath them now to juſtifie him, is the ſubject of our preſent Controverſie.</p>
            <p>He adds, <hi>But what a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable opinion our Author has of the preſent Government,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 79.</note> 
               <hi>and of all that comply with it, we may ſee in the parallel he makes between my Caſe, and that of <hi>Hazael.</hi> As if ſwearing to King</hi> William <hi>and Queen</hi> Mary, <hi>were as great, as notorious, as ſe f-evident an impiety and wickedneſs, as all the villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which the Prophet</hi> Eliſha <hi>foretold <hi>Hazael,</hi>
               </hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kings 8.12.</note> 
               <hi>that he would be guilty of: I know the Evil that thou wilt do unto the Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> their ſtrong holds wilt thou ſet on fire, and their young men wilt thou ſlay with the ſword, and wilt daſh their children, and rip up their women with child.</hi> Now the Doctor's Reader, (eſpecially if he be eaſie of belief) is to ſuppoſe that I ſaid all theſe matters, and made ſuch terrible compariſons; whereas in truth I ſaid no ſuch word, nor any thing like it. I compar'd indeed <hi>Hazael's</hi> change of mind,<note place="margin">Poſtſcr. p. 18.</note> and the Doctor s and what is that to the Government, or to thoſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </hi> and this would have been dreadful indeed, and would have ſhewn, what an opinion I had of his Arguments; whereas I do not think they are half ſo formidable, nor will do any miſchief at all. <hi>Hazael</hi> indeed, thought it was impoſſible for him do thoſe things, the Prophet told him he would do, and which afterwards he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally did. And had the like Queſtion been put to the Doctor concerning his preſent Opinions and Practices, I believe he would have return'd ſuch an Anſwer: <hi>i. e.</hi> he would have thought it as impoſſible for him to own and practiſe what he has done, as <hi>Hazael</hi> thought it impoſſible for him to do what he afterwards did. <hi>And what is this to my opinion of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of thoſe that comply with it?</hi> But this is another Artifice of the Doctor's: He would fain interpret what I ſay againſt him and his Hypotheſis, to be againſt the Government, and all thoſe that comply: whereas I diſpute againſt no body but him. He does not know, whether I have, or have not a charitable opinion of the Government, or the Complyers; but he knows what opinion I have of his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis and Arguments: and let him defend them as well as he can, without troubling himſelf with Inquiries that do not concern him, and entitling other men to matters that are peculiarly his own.</p>
            <p>To my Parting Requeſt, the Doctor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>I do affirm it again, That I was never factious againſt taking the Oaths, nor made it my buſineſs, to diſſwade men from it; when my Opinion was asked, I declared my own thoughts, but never ſought out men to make Proſelytes.</hi> Now he had been told, <hi>that <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> was a very long time,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Poſtſcr. p. 18.</note> 
               <hi>and ſome body or other might chance to remember.</hi> He anſwers, <hi>He fears not our Memories ſo much as our Inventions, and bids us produce the man.</hi> And yet for all this ſwaggering, the matter is not ſo very plain, but it needs a Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to help him off. And thus follows:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tho our Author ſeems very well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the thing call'd Faction (i. e.</hi> 'tis a very <hi>factious</hi> thing to write againſt the Doctor) <hi>yet he is not willing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the word; and therefore I muſt tell him, that when I ſay, <hi>I was never facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> againſt the Oath, I do not mean, that I was never hearty and zealous againſt taking the Oath; for I hope there may be Zeal without Faction; or that when I was preſſed to diſcourſe the matter, I did not talk with as much warmth and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as other men. But Faction is quite another thing, it ſhews it ſelf in Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Schiſms, in Rancour and Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Envyings and Emulations, in violent oppoſitions to Government, in changing and confining friendſhip to a Party, in Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Reproaches, in ſtigmatizing al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Perſons of another Perſwaſion as <hi>perjur'd Knaves.</hi>
               </hi> Theſe were intended for a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Adverſary and the Non-ſwe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rers. For he tells me, <hi>I ſeem to be well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the thing (faction),</hi> and ſo I am to thank him for all theſe fine Characters. Now I have no Anſwer to hard names, but methinks he might have ſpar'd <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Poſtſcr. p. 10.</note> 'till he had anſwer'd a ſmall Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion I put to him, about that affair.</p>
            <p>Now this is a very pleaſant buſineſs, the Doctor, I ſuppoſe, would perſwade me, to prove him a <hi>Schiſmatick, Bitter and Envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, a violent oppoſer of Government,</hi> &amp;c. for not taking the Oath. And yet he is ſo kind to beſtow all theſe favors upon us. And I do not know why they might not fit him as well in the ſame Capacity. But what he ſaid or did, is <hi>Heartineſs</hi> or <hi>Zeal,</hi> what we do is <hi>Faction,</hi> and I know not what. Now I will readily grant him, when he ſaid <hi>he was never engaged in any Faction againſt the Oath,</hi> he did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to call himſelf a <hi>Schiſmatick, Envious, Cenſorious,</hi> and all the hard Names above,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:107829:88"/> but that he did deſign likewiſe to quit himſelf of <hi>Heartineſs</hi> and <hi>Zeal,</hi> is evident enough, from the ſecond Page of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his <hi>Caſe of Allegiance.</hi> There he tells, <hi>Tho I refuſed to take the Oaths, I never engaged in any faction againſt it.</hi> And how does he prove that? It follows <hi>I never made it my buſineſs to diſſwade men from it; when my opinion was asked, I declared my own thoughts; but I never ſought out men to make Proſelytes.</hi> What is this to <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and <hi>Rancor,</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> and <hi>Emulation,</hi> and all the reſt of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l Thing,</hi> and perſwade them to what he conceives a Good Thing, without preſently being guilty of <hi>Schiſm</hi> and the Seven Deadly Sins? So that to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men from the Oath, eſpecially when not asked, is that which he means by <hi>Faction,</hi> or elſe his Paragraph is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with it ſelf. And as to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this kind, I tell him again, <hi>that <hi>never</hi> is a very long time.</hi> And a man that makes ſuch a bold aſſertion, had need be ſure of his own memory, before he charges other mens inventions. Well! But the Doctor is now for owning, that he was <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Zeal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And are not theſe pure Characters of <hi>Zeal</hi> never to make it our buſineſs to diſſwade men by all fair ways, from what we are <hi>Zealous</hi> againſt, and never to perſwade them to what we are <hi>Zeal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>der what he means by <hi>Zeal:</hi> it is indeed oppoſed to <hi>Faction;</hi> but it is oppoſed likewiſe to Coldneſs and Indifferency. And which is yet more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, he ſays in the ſame Preface, that <hi>he wiſhed he could have done</hi> (taken the Oaths) <hi>as others did.</hi> This is an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary inſtance of <hi>Zeal,</hi> to be <hi>Zealous</hi> againſt what we think an <hi>Ill Thing,</hi> and at the ſame time <hi>wiſh</hi> we could do it. He ſays he thought it an <hi>Ill Thing,</hi> and a few Line, after tells us, he <hi>wiſhed he could</hi> take it? This is ſuch a Zeal, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was heard of: Does Zeal againſt a thing, uſe to ſhew it ſelf in wiſhes and deſires towards it? This is an Argument of great inſincerity, but very little Zeal; ſo that whatever the Dr. may ſpeak of his Zeal and Warmth to ſtop an Objection, which could not otherwiſe be avoided, it is plain enough, that he took all care to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it as little as poſſible; and he hath given ſuch a cold and languid account of his management, while he was engaged againſt the Oath; That any man that is not blind or prejudic'd, may plainly ſee, that his wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He adds, <hi>Whereas tho there had been a material perjury, a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent opinion may excuſe from formal perjury;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 80.</note> 
               <hi>for no man is formally perjur'd, who does not know it. I ſhall not explain this by inſtances; for if our Author is for writing <hi>Secret Hiſtories,</hi> I am not ſo at preſent.</hi> This is dark and myſterie, and ſo it muſt remain, 'till the Doctor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it. He ſeems to inſinuate, that he knows ſome body or other, who have taken an Oath againſt their Conſciences: and it m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y be ſo, for any thing I know. Both he and the Author of the Letter to him, are very angry and pleviſh with me, for charging them with <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> and <hi>Perjury,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 72.</note> altho there is not the leaſt word of it in my Book: and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor knows what conſtruction the World has always made;<note place="margin">Lett. p. 32.</note> when men are careful and ſolicitous to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate an accuſation, which was never made againſt them.</p>
            <p>As for his Parting and Concluſion, I have only this to obſerve, That the Doctor hath the <hi>modeſteſt</hi> way of ending his Books that ever I ſaw. His <hi>Vindication of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:107829:88"/> Doctrine of the Trinity,</hi> and his <hi>Doctrine of Self-conſciouſneſs,</hi> he ends thus, <hi>I am pretty confident he will never be able to reaſon to any purpoſe, in this Cauſe again.</hi> Altho he hath given his Adverſary the greateſt Advantage, and inſtead of vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, hath mightily prejudic'd that Article of the Chriſtian Faith, by clogging it with <hi>New Notions;</hi> and which in a ſettled State of the Church, would hardly have eſcap'd Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure. His <hi>Caſe of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> concludes, with <hi>hoping he may ſatisfie them</hi> (thoſe not of his mind) <hi>that he hath <hi>ſomething</hi> to ſay for himſelf,</hi> a <hi>Mei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſis,</hi> very great, conſiderable, unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And he ends his <hi>Vindication,</hi> with telling me, <hi>if I will promiſe to examine his Arguments well before I anſwer, he ſhall expect to hear no more from me.</hi> And yet a man would be apt to imagine, that falſe Reaſonings, Artificial Shifts and Diſtinctions, plain and downright Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions in the Premiſes, were an unequal foundation, to ſupport ſo much <hi>Triumph</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> in the Concluſion. However the Doctor finds he is miſtaken; he hath <hi>heard from me</hi> again. But whether <hi>I have examin'd his Arguments <hi>well,</hi>
               </hi> I ſhall leave to the Reader's Judgment, and to the Doctor's Examination.</p>
